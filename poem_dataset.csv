"I was sympathetic to language, but often it shrugged me and kept other lovers. I crawled through the commas of   Romanticism and rejected the rhythms, though sometimes at night I could feel a little sad. I could emerge now  into a new kind of style, but the market  is already flooded and my people have lost faith in things meant to land  a clear yes or no. It’s good to welcome a stranger into the house. Introduce her to everyone sitting at the table and wash  your hands before you serve her, lest the residue of other meals affect your  affections. “If something is beautiful we do  not even experience pain as pain.” (A man said that.) “I think I owe all words to my friends.” (I said that.) “We speak to one another  in circles alone with ourselves.” (He said  that, too.) That’s why we go to war. We’ve gotten too big to be friends with  everyone and so I like to feel the fellowship of the person next to me shooting out across a foreign plain. The streams  of light on the horizon are something I share with him and this is also a feeling of love. I spoke to his widow and touched  his dog. I told his daughter how his last breath was Homeric and spoke of nothing but returning home. The way I’m strapped into myself I can’t escape. Wake up and be a better person! Clip your toenails, and by sun-rise make sure  you’re sitting at the table reading Arendt.  With a little focus I could become everything I ever wished to be: level-headed and buoyed,  a real (wo)manIncapable of limiting themselves to petty offenses, my hands broke into my chest and choked every slumbering deity.

"When, at the end, the children wanted  to add glitter to their valentines, I said no.   I said , and then,  when they started to fuss, I found myself   saying something my brother’s football coach  used to bark from the sidelines when one   of his players showed signs of being  human:   That’s what I said to my children.   my daughter asked,   and, because she is so young, I told her  I didn’t know and never mind, and she took   that for an answer. My children are so young  when I turn off the radio as the news turns   to counting the dead or naming the act,  they aren’t even suspicious. My children   are so young they cannot imagine a world  like the one they live in. Their God is still   a real God, a whole God, a God made wholly  of actions. And I think they think I work   for that God. And I know they will someday soon  see everything and they will know about   everything and they will no longer take  never mind for an answer. The valentines   would’ve been better with glitter, and my son  hurt himself on an envelope, and then, much   later, when we were eating dinner, my daughter  realized she’d forgotten one of the three   Henrys in her class. I said, and she said,   And so, before bed we took everything out  again—paper and pens and stamps and scissors—  and she sat at the table with her freshly washed hair  parted smartly down the middle and wrote    and she did it  so carefully, I could hardly stand to watch.

"We walk through clouds wrapped in ancient symbols  We descend the hill wearing water   Maybe we are dead  and don’t know it  Maybe we are violet flowers and those we long for   love only  our unmade hearts    Wait for Duras and Eminescu  to tell us in French then Romanian     Wait until the nails get rusty  in the houses of our past.

"Love me stupid. Love me terrible. And when I am no mountain but rather a monsoon of imperfect thunder love me. When I am blue in my face from swallowing myself yet wearing my best heart even if my best heart is a century of hunger an angry mule breathing hard or perhaps even hopeful. A small sun. Little & bright.

"I climbed a mountain and the air constricted breathing— the terrain of the free spirit, that creature so dedicated to surmounting that the mountain, its hanging glacier, its granite slabs cut through by the trail, its heaps of rocks blocking reasonable access to the turquoise lake beneath, its wildflowers with their fraying lackadaisical paintbrushes, went by in my eyes so quickly I never truly left the not-yet-turning aspens, carved by local lovers who loved themselves so much they stayed right there with their knives until they finished their names. I remembered what it was like, knowing what you want to eat and then making it, forgetting about the ending in the middle, looking at the ocean for  a long time without restlessness, or with restlessness not inhabiting the joints, sitting Indian style on a porch overlooking that water, smooth like good cake",Love
"You could smell the day’s heat even before the day began.  Constant trickle, endless green trees flanking the highway:  summer had come back. Scattered trash  on the apartment landing. Everyone passed by it. Everyone felt it belonged to someone else.   Grey fog, blue sunlight, stones like big footprints in a wavering line across a lawn. Everyone was talking about a new song  in relation to the old: Standing on the porch  just before the drizzle,  fiercely missing my sister, how we used to take the bag  of cut grass from the lawnmower  and empty it over our bodies like rain.   Days lost between the clock and my phone: I made coffee, I brushed the cat, I went to work, I knew the time it took to go from one room to another  to collect my ironed shirt. I kept looking back  to isolate individual moments, asking why didn’t I give myself more fully to that  friend, that stranger, that drinking, those days. I remembered Kira and Chicago,  looked hurt. I watched a chained dog strain at every passerby. I thought,   Meanwhile, I’d gotten older. I’d grown  accustomed to my body.  I could sit with my shirt off on a hot day and not think about how my body looked  or how I felt inside it.  Cutting my hair the barber said,   I liked her phrasing. I walked forever. I was trying not to revise history to make my present life make sense. Raised voices; faded t-shirts left in boxes on the street.  Such strange intimacies.  The telephones ringing  in the houses as I passed.  ",Love

"The night comes down, in ever-darkening shapes that seem— To grope, with eerie fingers for the window—then— To rest to sleep, enfolding me, as in a dream  Faith—might I awaken!

"When the bottle of hot sauce shattered in the kitchen he stood in the doorframe, shook his head at the mess.   Not worried if I was injured, mostly curious at what else it was I’d broken.   You are so clumsy with the things you hold, he never said.   The red stain on my chest bloomed pungent, soaked any apology.   I used his shirt, the one I slept in, to wipe the counter and pale-colored kitchen floor.   That night and the next for a straight week as he prepared boxes to leave   I hunched and scrubbed the tiles. Couldn’t rid myself of the things that I’d sullied, of the look he left behind. Yesterday, the final petal curled its soft lure into bone.  The flowerhead shed clean, I gathered up your spine  and built you on a dark day. You are still missing  some parts. Each morning, I curl red psalms into the shells  Pleasure is black.  I no longer imagine   where my body  stops or begins.  Skin transparent. Face speckled  by the spit of several centuries.  All the borders stare at the same fires.  Oh Mamere,   I'm sorry.  Here I am. ",Love
"Staring at the stars, I imagine you vanished and dispersed in that unreachable clarity of light. They glisten, sharp and cold, vast distances apart yet coming to their marks the same time every night of their season.  The seasons slowly move, carrying their forms— I recognize so few: Orion with his belt dominating winter, a wobbly W, the dipper’s angled box and handle, each bright dot individually jeweled there.  Nothing there is fixed, not even that clear star that seems always to point just one way as it speeds farther and farther off. All of them are whirling on their separate paths, circles and ellipses, poles of radiance that spread the dark.  What can be made of that? If you are nothing now but memory, the stars seem a proper home. Long after the sun swells to disperse the earth, they’ll change as you have, light vanishing with time, light beyond the reach of light itself.  Staring at the light an explosion sent from some place nowhere now, I know it will outlast whatever I become. Imagining its end, I see it moving still when nothing can be seen and we are both nothing everywhere. ",Love

"I dreamt—before death made such dreaming vain— That sometime, on a day of wind and rain, I would come home to you at fall of night And see your window flushed with firelight. There in the chill dark lonesomeness I’d wait A moment, standing at the garden gate Scarce trusting that my happiness was true,— The kind warm lights of home and love and you.  Then, lest they’d vanish to be mine no more, I’d speed my steps along the garden path, Cross my own threshold, close the wind-blown door And find you in the firelight of the hearth. O happiness! to kneel beside you there And feel your fingers resting on my hair.  In misty cerements they wrapped the word My heart had feared so long: dead... dead... I heard But marvelled they could think the thing was true Because death cannot be for such as you. So while they spoke kind words to suit my need Of foolish idle things my heart took heed, Your racquet and worn-out tennis shoe,Would God that I might build my love in stone That would out-time the centuries and dare Despiteful death to lay his finger there, So that your fame to all men might be known; A minister church, crowned with a soaring spire, Great buttressed walls, clerestory, lofty nave, Deep carven doors and every window braveWhen I can dare at last to speak your name It shall not be with hushed and reverent speech As if your spirit were beyond the reach Of homely merry things, kind jest or game.

"When I smell the dirt on the oiled leather I fear that I am leaving everyone to become A field of wind and sunlight. I climb a stone wall to look at the ocean With a bird call stuck in my mind. The frog, my spirit animal, cocks Its bulging eyeball at me and its throat Enlarges as if to laugh, to engulf All the air since neither of us wishes to live In a gloomy house of fish scales And neither of us can perform basic manual tasks Like re-greasing the axle, repotting the hydrangea Or knitting a new sweater maybe Because I dropped the knife on my toes When I was 8—I was trying to hack A pumpkin from its vine but the mouse Darting through the garden startled me And some spec or mote dove into The abyss of my insides where I am The night watchman at the perfume factory Where the machines never quit humming Where the stench is overwhelming Where I have to wear a mask or I’ll black out I’ll float down the river, get stuck in the reeds Or torn to shreds in the sudden eddies. Blood gushed from my big toe but the knife Didn’t make a clean cut. Something else was wounded So I put on my gold star badge. I, sheriff Of the cosmos, must cordon off the attic. The mold has made it unstable and besides No one can breathe, even with the oxygen pump That the doctor left dangling in the branches Of the oak that shades the eastern side of the yard. The cabbages look neon in the maturing sun— There’s time for one last cup of coffee before The raindrops dive straight at the old glove And bucket of balls. When the sky clouds over It’s like Dad’s staring at me again. I’m not even sleeping. It’s the middle of the day And he lives 200 miles away— He just buried his dog in a black mound near the pond He just opened a box of love letters He just ran his finger over the lumpy dough Remembering when we stopped by the big lake On our way to the museum—the sun had just come up And I felt like I was holding a hammer That would break the glossy water into little pieces That would spin around the lookout station— I was 10 or 11. I had just discovered hairspray— I was trying to make my head a hammer But this is not a memoir—this is not a personal account Of each burning nanosecond of wakefulness. I picked up the old mitt just to smell the leather. ",Love

"When smoke stood up from Ludlow,  And mist blew off from Teme, And blithe afield to ploughing  Against the morning beam  I strode beside my team,  The blackbird in the coppice  Looked out to see me stride, And hearkened as I whistled  The trampling team beside,  And fluted and replied:  ‘Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;  What use to rise and rise? Rise man a thousand mornings  Yet down at last he lies,  And then the man is wise.’  I heard the tune he sang me,  And spied his yellow bill; I picked a stone and aimed it  And threw it with a will:  Then the bird was still.  Then my soul within me  Took up the blackbird’s strain, And still beside the horses  Along the dewy lane  It sang the song again:  ‘Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;  The sun moves always west; The road one treads to labour  Will lead one home to rest,  And that will be the best.’ Into my heart on air that kills   From yon far country blows:  What are those blue remembered hills,   What spires, what farms are those?

"   So much like sequins the sunlight on this river. Something like that kiss—   remember? , with the moon down earlythe air moved   as if it were thinking, as if it had begun to understand   how hard it is  to feel at home in the world,   but that night she found a place just above your shoulder   and pressed her lips there. Soft rain   had called off the fireworks: the sky was quiet, but back on Earth   two boys cruised by on bikes trying out bad words. You turned to reach her mouth,   at last, with yoursafter weeks of long walks, talking   about former loves gone awry—   how the soul finally falls down   and gets up alone once more   finding the city strange, the streets unmarked.  Every time you meet someone it’s hard not to wonder   who they’ve been—one story breaking so much   into the next: memory engraves its hesitations—   but that night you found yourself unafraid. Do you remember   what the wind told the trees about her brown hair?— how the cool dark turned around:   that first kiss, long as a river.   Didn’t it seem like you already loved her?   Off the sidewalk: a small pond, the tall cattails, all those sleepy koi   coloring the water. Five-legged pocket spiders, knuckled starfish, grabbers of forks, why do I forget that you love me: your willingness to button my shirts, tie my shoes—even scratch my head! which throbs like a traffic jam, each thought leaning on its horn.

Here above I scribble and re-scribble The words of a long-dead Greek Poet: “Love, thou art terrible, Ah, Love, thou are bitter-sweet!”  I have been a spendthrift Dropping from lazy fingers Quiet coloured hours, Fluttering away from me Like oak and beech leaves in October.  I have lived keenly and wastefully, Like a bush or a sun insect— Lived sensually and thoughtfully, Loving the flesh and the beauty of this world— Green ivy about ruined towersOne night I wandered alone from my comrades’ huts; The grasshoppers chirped softly In the warm misty evening; Bracken fronds beckoned from the darkness With exquisite frail green fingers; The tree gods muttered affectionately about me, And from the distance came the grumble of a kindly train.

"Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day; And give us not to think so far away As the uncertain harvest; keep us here All simply in the springing of the year.  Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white, Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night; And make us happy in the happy bees, The swarm dilating round the perfect trees.  And make us happy in the darting bird That suddenly above the bees is heard, The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill, And off a blossom in mid air stands still.  For this is love and nothing else is love, The which it is reserved for God above To sanctify to what far ends He will, But which it only needs that we fulfil.  Now close the windows and hush all the fields;  If the trees must, let them silently toss; No bird is singing now, and if there is,  Be it my loss.

"Lovers, forget your love,  And list to the love of these, She a window flower,  And he a winter breeze.  When the frosty window veil  Was melted down at noon, And the cagèd yellow bird  Hung over her in tune,  He marked her through the pane,  He could not help but mark, And only passed her by,  To come again at dark.  He was a winter wind,  Concerned with ice and snow, Dead weeds and unmated birds,  And little of love could know.  But he sighed upon the sill,  He gave the sash a shake, As witness all within  Who lay that night awake.  Perchance he half prevailed  To win her for the flight From the firelit looking-glass  And warm stove-window light.

"A house that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master,  With doors that none but the wind ever closes, Its floor all littered with glass and with plaster;  It stands in a garden of old-fashioned roses.  I pass by that way in the gloaming with Mary;   ‘I wonder,’ I say, ‘who the owner of those is. ‘Oh, no one you know,’ she answers me airy,  ‘But one we must ask if we want any roses.’  So we must join hands in the dew coming coldly  There in the hush of the wood that reposes, And turn and go up to the open door boldly,  And knock to the echoes as beggars for roses.  ‘Pray, are you within there, Mistress Who-were-you?’  ’Tis Mary that speaks and our errand discloses. ‘Pray, are you within there? Bestir you, bestir you!  ’Tis summer again; there’s two come for roses.  ‘A word with you, that of the singer recalling—  Old Herrick: a saying that every maid knows is  A flower unplucked is but left to the falling,  And nothing is gained by not gathering roses.’  We do not loosen our hands’ intertwining  (Not caring so very much what she supposes), There when she comes on us mistily shining  And grants us by silence the boon of her roses. Love at the lips was touch As sweet as I could bear; And once that seemed too much; I lived on air  That crossed me from sweet things, The flow of—was it musk From hidden grapevine springs Downhill at dusk?

The bridegroom came forth into the porch  With ‘Let us look at the sky, And question what of the night to be,  Stranger, you and I.’ The woodbine leaves littered the yard,  The woodbine berries were blue, Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;  ‘Stranger, I wish I knew.’  Within, the bride in the dusk alone  Bent over the open fire, Her face rose-red with the glowing coal  And the thought of the heart’s desire.  The bridegroom looked at the weary road,  Yet saw but her within, And wished her heart in a case of gold  And pinned with a silver pin.  The bridegroom thought it little to give  A dole of bread, a purse, A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God,  Or for the rich a curse;  But whether or not a man was asked  To mar the love of two By harboring woe in the bridal house,  The bridegroom wished he knew.

" LINES WRITTEN TO AN ALBUM PRINT.   As on this pictured page I look,  This pretty tale of line and hook  As though it were a novel-book  Amuses and engages:  I know them both, the boy and girl;  She is the daughter of the Earl,  The lad (that has his hair in curl)  My lord the County's page has.   A pleasant place for such a pair!  The fields lie basking in the glare;  No breath of wind the heavy air  Of lazy summer quickens.  Hard by you see the castle tall;  The village nestles round the wall,  As round about the hen its small  Young progeny of chickens.   It is too hot to pace the keep;  To climb the turret is too steep;  My lord the earl is dozing deep,  His noonday dinner over:  The postern-warder is asleep  (Perhaps they've bribed him not to peep):  And so from out the gate they creep,  And cross the fields of clover.   Their lines into the brook they launch;  He lays his cloak upon a branch,  To guarantee his Lady Blanche  's delicate complexion:  He takes his rapier, from his haunch,  That beardless doughty champion staunch;  He'd drill it through the rival's paunch  That question'd his affection!   O heedless pair of sportsmen slack!  You never mark, though trout or jack,  Or little foolish stickleback,  Your baited snares may capture.  What care has SHE for line and hook?  She turns her back upon the brook,  Upon her lover's eyes to look  In sentimental rapture.   O loving pair! as thus I gaze  Upon the girl who smiles always,  The little hand that ever plays  Upon the lover's shoulder;  In looking at your pretty shapes,  A sort of envious wish escapes  (Such as the Fox had for the Grapes)  The Poet your beholder.   To be brave, handsome, twenty-two;  With nothing else on earth to do,  But all day long to bill and coo:  It were a pleasant calling.  And had I such a partner sweet;  A tender heart for mine to beat,  A gentle hand my clasp to meet;—  I'd let the world flow at my feet,  And never heed its brawling.

Winter and summer, night and morn,  I languish at this table dark;  My office window has a corn-  er looks into St. James's Park.

" Thank Heaven! the crisis—  The danger is past,  And the lingering illness  Is over at last—  And the fever called “Living”  Is conquered at last.   Sadly, I know  I am shorn of my strength,  And no muscle I move  As I lie at full length—  But no matter!—I feel  I am better at length.   And I rest so composedly,  Now, in my bed,  That any beholder  Might fancy me dead—  Might start at beholding me,  Thinking me dead.   The moaning and groaning,  The sighing and sobbing,  Are quieted now,  With that horrible throbbing  At heart:—ah, that horrible,  Horrible throbbing!   The sickness—the nausea—  The pitiless pain—  Have ceased, with the fever  That maddened my brain—  With the fever called “Living”  That burned in my brain.   And oh! of all tortures  That torture the worst  Has abated—the terrible  Torture of thirst  For the naphthaline river  Of Passion accurst:—  I have drank of a water  That quenches all thirst:—   Of a water that flows,  With a lullaby sound,  From a spring but a very few  Feet under ground—  From a cavern not very far  Down under ground.   And ah! let it never  Be foolishly said  That my room it is gloomy  And narrow my bed;  For man never slept  In a different bed—  And, to sleep, you must slumber  In just such a bed.   My tantalized spirit  Here blandly reposes,  Forgetting, or never  Regretting its roses—  Its old agitations  Of myrtles and roses:   For now, while so quietly  Lying, it fancies  A holier odor  About it, of pansies—  A rosemary odor,  Commingled with pansies—  With rue and the beautiful  Puritan pansies.   And so it lies happily,  Bathing in many  A dream of the truth  And the beauty of Annie—  Drowned in a bath  Of the tresses of Annie.   She tenderly kissed me,  She fondly caressed,  And then I fell gently  To sleep on her breast—  Deeply to sleep  From the heaven of her breast.   When the light was extinguished,  She covered me warm,  And she prayed to the angels  To keep me from harm—  To the queen of the angels  To shield me from harm.   And I lie so composedly,  Now in my bed,  (Knowing her love)  That you fancy me dead—  And I rest so contentedly,  Now in my bed,  (With her love at my breast)  That you fancy me dead—  That you shudder to look at me,  Thinking me dead:—   But my heart it is brighter  Than all of the many  Stars in the sky,  For it sparkles with Annie—  It glows with the light  Of the love of my Annie—  With the thought of the light  Of the eyes of my Annie.  Dim vales—and shadowy floods—  And cloudy-looking woods,  Whose forms we can’t discover  For the tears that drip all over  Huge moons there wax and wane—  Again—again—again—  Every moment of the night—  Forever changing places Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary  Of lofty contemplation left to Time  By buried centuries of pomp and power!

"It’s the last few hours of a county fair, or the ninth inning, score tied, in a small-town high school big game, everything that’s going to happen destined to feel inevitable. Everett’s favorite cow has yet to win a prize, and what occurs next on the field will likely determine whether a certain boy, years later, will run for mayor, or still be known as the guy who dropped the ball. Elsewhere in the same town Pastor William is writing down his sermon on what it takes to live a moral life, confusing rectitude with deprivation, and his wife’s frequent, unapologetic nothing-for-you-tonight-dear. Tomorrow, no doubt, because this happens in towns both large and small, seventh-grade Joshua, who knows the answer, but won’t go to the chalkboard because he has a hard-on, is thought to be dumb. That is, until he proves he’s not, the answer written down in code for Mr. Zenner to see, perhaps to understand. Sharon the beauty is also smart and her pet pig wins Best in Class, but she won’t accept the award. The family needs money, but the prize is given by the DAR, and she wants to take a stand. It seems inevitable that in a town this size Joshua and Sharon will marry, but she goes to a faraway college, meets Nathaniel, a city boy who knows nothing about pigs but something about integrity. They fall in love and the rest, as they say, is history—babies and hardship, grad school and in her case visits to the now curious place that was home— Joshua working the counter at Beal’s Hardware, Thursday night bingo at the church— how things could have been had she not become someone else.She pressed her lips to mind. —a typo  How many years I must have yearned for someone’s lips against mind.

It seemed so heartless, how you wanted it to end. I noticed on the nurse who took his pulse a heart tattooed above her collarbone. The kids played hearts all night to pass the time. You said that at its heart rejection was impossible to understand. “We send our heartfelt sympathy,” was written in the card your mother sent, in flowing script. I tried interpreting his EKG, which looked like knife wounds to the heart. I knew enough to guess he wouldn’t last much longer. As if we’d learned our lines by heart, you said, “I can’t explain.” “Please don’t,” was my reply. They say the heart is just a muscle. Or the heart is where the human soul resides. I saw myself in you; you looked so much like him. You didn’t have the heart to say you didn’t want me anymore.

"The round, hanging lanterns, lit faces in a window of the Marble Palace Catherine the Great built for a lover,  with the Field of Mars below, snow falling inside two minds.  One translated Babylonian folktales so the other could stand in line early morning  for bread at the House of Scholars. A touch of dawn was again nightfall, their room furnished with scattered papers, rare books, a couch with springs poking out, a bookcase, a floral pitcher, a china cabinet, a naked light bulb dangling over a table. Did the two poets learn it took more to sing & reflect the burning icy stars  of poetry where privilege & squalor lived beneath the same ornate ceiling? Did they tiptoe from the wintery dusk of the servants’ wing, follow the pseudo- Gothic stairs up to the forbidden aromas of Turkish tobacco, sugar, & exotic teas? Sometimes, they kept themselves warm with talk of the empress’s love of horses as they galloped another century. Then,  sketches of their time at the Stray Dog lit the air around those neoclassic nights, & maybe they also spoke about “Venice rotting with gold” near the Arctic Circle, & anger almost kept them warm on days they bent over pages of snow-blindness where tears brought them to laughter.I sit beside two women, kitty-corner  to the stage, as Elvin's sticks blur  the club into a blue fantasia. I thought my body had forgotten the Deep  South, how I'd cross the street if a woman like these two walked  towards me, as if a cat traversed  my path beneath the evening star.

"“Like so many of my attempts, this poem uses the etymology of a word as a sort of, well, trellis. And it is a meditation on how sun and flower dance, deny and entangle each other—that is, it is an examination of how in the natural world, as in poetry, form is more fundamental than matter.”  — Bin RamkeLucretius loved Epicurus, knew the world through him; his meaning was clear: love as a way of knowing, of assuming the known.  To know is to narrate. People die trying to tell what it was like there then. Others die of not trying. The form of this telling is, for example, a trellis. A growth controlled unpredictable within measure.  Trellis. . three threads. The weaver knows through the fingers the way worlds hold together. Basket makers.

"We imagine Natalie held a gelatinous green  sliver on her tongue, that its watery   disk caught the lamplight before  she slipped from her yacht   to drown in the waves off this island. This was thirty years ago. And our tomato’s strain   stretches back decades, to an heirloom seed  saved before either of us was born,   before Natalie’s elbow  brushed the clouded jade   face of the ancestral fruit in a Catalina stand, before she handed it  to her husband, saying, This one. We hover near the plate, where the last   half of our shadowed tomato  sits in its skin’s deep pleats. I lean   toward you to trace each  salted crease with a thumbnail—  brined and wild as those lines  clawed in the green   side of the yacht’s  rubber dinghy. Those lingering   shapes the coroner found—the drowned  actress’s scratch marks. That night  we first met, I had another lover  but you didn’t   care. My Bellini’s peach puree,  our waiter said, had sailed across   the Atlantic, from France. It swirled  as I sipped and sank   to the glass bottom  of my champagne flute. You whispered,   Guilt is the most useless emotion. After Natalie rolled   into the waves, the wet feathers of her down coat wrapped   their white anchors  at her hips. This was 1981. I turned   a year old that month and somewhere  an heirloom seed   washed up. You felt an odd breeze  knock at your elbow as I took  my first step. We hadn’t yet met.

There's a room in your breath I crawl into, eating the wallpaper's yellow, looking out for the man on the stairs, his knife in hand, poise incarnate. I am your minimum envelope, your string between tin cans and cannot stop the talk between us.  In Berlin, they lay buildings on concrete slabs that look straight back at us. The windows of the soul seek to err on the side of humanity. Put a piece of glass between us for less resistance. Invite rococo scrawl in heated breath upon it. The moon appears in a cinched waist.  Stand penance atop her curvature's axis,  above a hill where headstones claw up  through the clouds, pulling their fibers  into blankets across us.  The sleet and silver smiles loom, gauze-thin.

"We know from accounts of the judgment of Paris how Love took first:  the apple burnished by—it turns out—her own husband, working the bellows, forging to Discord's specifications, her need to break the spaghetti strands of marriage, her undiluted vitriol, that oversaw his flux and foundry,  guided the sparking hammer to its urgent deed.  Spoils of war.  Power, undeterred and wily as it always is, the figural eye and its agency, took gladly the second chair, from which advantage machinations could be seen. Advised, conferred, deployed the second wave of ships, provided mercenary aid to every side and fanned the air, and made her counsel with all sides, supporting every one and none, out-waiting tides.  If we believe the Greeks, the spokes of Fortune's wheel in constant turn would allow the last to be the first—beatitudes bestowed upon the losing side,  a draught of time in which the wily ones, by their equine portage made the mind the victor over Love's inconstancy and strife, and, over brute acts, gave thought dominion in a golden age. But that's just myth.  Wisdom, you are the last to whom I turn. Not for your spear,  fashioned in that same fire as all bright jealous objects of desire. But for your shield. Protect the least of us.

"By the detergents and dish soap by the orderly books and broom on the floor, by the clean windows, by the table without papers, notebooks or pens, by the easy chairs without newspapers, whoever approaches my house will find a day that is completely Friday.  That is how I find it when I go out into the streets and the cathedral has been taken over by the world of the living and in the supermarket June becomes a bottle of gin, sausages and dessert, fan of light in the kiosk of the flower shop, city that undresses completely Friday.

"While jogging on the treadmill at the gym, that exercise in getting nowhere fast, I realized we need a health pandemic. Obesity writ large no more, Alzheimer's forgotten, we could live carefree again. We'd chant the painted shaman's sweaty oaths, We'd kiss the awful relics of the saints, we'd sip the bitter tea from twisted roots, we'd listen to our grandmothers' advice. We'd understand the moonlight's whispering. We'd exercise by making love outside,  and afterwards, while thinking only of how much we'd lived in just one moment's time, forgive ourselves for wanting something more: to praise the memory of long-lost need, or not to live forever in a world  made painless by our incurable joy.

"I'm traveling back home to you but it's an omen: my road map's creased and torn along dead straight lines.  The hill and gully ride is over now and I'm flat out on the dead straight highway with a toll.  Not a glimmer of the coastline as I try to make it home to you through a forest of hotels as thick as thieves.  For the sea, the coves and beaches once seen through seaside shacks and palm trees have been sold.  And the rest of us are herded to the verge by this new highway while over there our beauty is extolled,  bottled and sold. And gated. In this new paradise the only palms are greased. And somebody's beach umbrella  has replaced the shade tree we once sat under and the towns and settlements molder as they are bypassed.  I can no longer witness on this highway with a toll that makes us seem as modern as elsewhere. For elsewhere  is not where I'm meant to be. And a dead straight highway leaves no scent, no monument to the past,  no scenic beauty for the curvature of my eye to take in. And endless empty space is not inviting. But perhaps  there's no social meaning to this tirade after all. I'm just feeling lost without a map as I make it home to you  and pay the toll. You could see it simply as a love song.

"I have been thinking about the love-hat relationship. It is the relationship based on love of one another's hats.  The problem with the love-hat relationship is that it is superficial.  You don't necessarily even know the other person.  Also it is too dependent on whether the other person  is even wearing the favored hat. We all enjoy hats, but they're not something to build an entire relationship on. My advice to young people is to like hats but not love them. Try having like-hat relationships with one another.  See if you can find something interesting about  the personality of the person whose hat you like.What the bad news was became apparent too late for us to do anything good about it.

This puts you both in a difficult position, panting lovers who are prevented from touching not by bars but by circumstance: you have terrible fights and say cruel things, for having the hots does not give you a sweet temper.  One night you are walking down a dark street and hear the padpad of a panther following you, but when you turn around there are only shadows, or perhaps one shadow too many  You approach, calling, ""Who's there?"" and it leaps on you. Luckily you have brought along your sword, and you stab it to death.  And before your eyes it turns into the woman you love, her breast impaled on your sword, her mouth dribbling blood saying she loved you but couldn't help her tendency.  So death released her from the curse at last, and you knew from the angelic smile on her dead face that in spite of a life the devil owned, love had won, and heaven pardoned her.",Love
"She pressed her lips to mind. —a typo  How many years I must have yearned for someone’s lips against mind. Pheromones, newly born, were floating between us. There was hardly any air.  She kissed me again, reaching that place that sends messages to toes and fingertips, then all the way to something like home. Some music was playing on its own.  Nothing like a woman who knows to kiss the right thing at the right time, then kisses the things she’s missed. How had I ever settled for less?  I was thinking this is intelligence, this is the wisest tongue since the Oracle got into a Greek’s ear, speaking sense. It’s the Good,  defining itself. I was out of my mind. She was in. We married as soon as we could. Mrs. Cavendish desired the man in the fedora  who danced the tarantella without regard for who might care. All her life she had a weakness for abandon, and, if the music stopped, for anyone who could turn a phrase.

"What things are steadfast? Not the birds. Not the bride and groom who hurry in their brevity to reach one another. The stars do not blow away as we do. The heavenly things ignite and freeze. But not as my hair falls before you. Fragile and momentary, we continue. Fearing madness in all things huge and their requiring. Managing as thin light on water. Managing only greetings and farewells. We love a little, as the mice huddle, as the goat leans against my hand. As the lovers quickening, riding time. Making safety in the moment.

"On the Canadian side, we're standing far enough away the Falls look like photography, the roar a radio.  In the real rain, so vertical it fuses with the air, the boat below us is starting for the caves.  Everyone on deck is dressed in black, braced for weather and crossing against the current of the river.  They seem lost in the gorge dimensions of the place, then, in fog, in a moment, gone.   In the Chekhov story, the lovers live in a cloud, above the sheer witness of a valley.  They call it circumstance. They look up at the open wing of the sky, or they look down into the future.  Death is a power like any other pull of the earth. The people in the raingear with the cameras want to see it  from the inside, from behind, from the dark looking into the light. They want to take its picture, give it size—  how much easier to get lost in the gradations of a large and yellow leaf drifting its good-bye down one side of the gorge.  There is almost nothing that does not signal loneliness, then loveliness, then something connecting all we will become.

Have I been here a week? I've slept so long I can't remember who was with me last night in bed, that figure leaning against the door? Did he leave me this gold bangle? I can feel its heft around my wrist, knobs and crests, a design from the high Mogul period of Aurangazeb.  I have come to Delhi to remember our ancient past—so little, a bangle,  what else? When it slid over my hand, I opened myself like a book and you hear its private pulsing. In the quiet he said, Put your hand here  to save your place. I put my hand there, and he pressed it. He sat with me a minute, and he went away, left something to hinge me in the wind of myself, to calm my legs. Empire is large land and I can't touch it. A smile is a root my mother said don't bother.

"You are not beautiful, exactly. You are beautiful, inexactly. You let a weed grow by the mulberry and a mulberry grow by the house. So close, in the personal quiet of a windy night, it brushes the wall and sweeps away the day till we sleep.  A child said it, and it seemed true: ""Things that are lost are all equal.""

"We find out the heart only by dismantling what the heart knows. By redefining the morning, we find a morning that comes just after darkness. We can break through marriage into marriage.

We seemed to be moving from some old house where we'd lived, boxes everywhere, things in disarray: that was the of my dream, but even asleep I was shocked out of the narrative  by your face, the physical fact of your face: inches from mine, smooth-shaven, loving, alert. Why so difficult, remembering the actual look of you? Without a photograph, without strain?  So when I saw your unguarded, reliable face, your unmistakable gaze opening all the warmth and clarity of you--warm brown tea--we held each other for the time the dream allowed.  Bless you.

"Of asphodel, that greeny flower, like a buttercup upon its branching stem- save that it's green and wooden- I come, my sweet, to sing to you. We lived long together a life filled, if you will, with flowers. So that  I was cheered when I came first to know that there were flowers also in hell. Today I'm filled with the fading memory of those flowers that we both loved, even to this poor colorless thing- I saw it when I was a child- little prized among the living but the dead see, asking among themselves: What do I remember that was shaped as this thing is shaped? while our eyes fill with tears. Of love, abiding love it will be telling though too weak a wash of crimson colors it to make it wholly credible. There is something something urgent I have to say to you and you alone but it must wait while I drink in the joy of your approach, perhaps for the last time. And so with fear in my heart I drag it out and keep on talking for I dare not stop. Listen while I talk on against time. It will not be for long. I have forgot and yet I see clearly enough something central to the sky which ranges round it. An odor springs from it! A sweetest odor! Honeysuckle! And now there comes the buzzing of a bee! and a whole flood of sister memories! Only give me time, time to recall them before I shall speak out. Give me time, time. When I was a boy I kept a book to which, from time to time, I added pressed flowers until, after a time, I had a good collection. The asphodel, forebodingly, among them. I bring you, reawakened, a memory of those flowers. They were sweet when I pressed them and retained something of their sweetness a long time. It is a curious odor, a moral odor, that brings me near to you. The color was the first to go. There had come to me a challenge, your dear self, mortal as I was, the lily's throat to the hummingbird! Endless wealth, I thought, held out its arms to me. A thousand tropics in an apple blossom. The generous earth itself gave us lief. The whole world became my garden! But the sea which no one tends is also a garden when the sun strikes it and the waves are wakened. I have seen it and so have you when it puts all flowers to shame. Too, there are the starfish stiffened by the sun and other sea wrack and weeds. We knew that along with the rest of it for we were born by the sea, knew its rose hedges to the very water's brink. There the pink mallow grows and in their season strawberries and there, later, we went to gather the wild plum. I cannot say that I have gone to hell for your love but often found myself there in your pursuit. I do not like it and wanted to be in heaven. Hear me out. Do not turn away. I have learned much in my life from books and out of them about love. Death is not the end of it. There is a hierarchy which can be attained, I think, in its service. Its guerdon is a fairy flower; a cat of twenty lives. If no one came to try it the world would be the loser. It has been for you and me as one who watches a storm come in over the water. We have stood from year to year before the spectacle of our lives with joined hands. The storm unfolds. Lightning plays about the edges of the clouds. The sky to the north is placid, blue in the afterglow as the storm piles up. It is a flower that will soon reach the apex of its bloom. We danced, in our minds, and read a book together. You remember? It was a serious book. And so books entered our lives. The sea! The sea! Always when I think of the sea there comes to mind the Iliad and Helen's public fault that bred it. Were it not for that there would have been  no poem but the world if we had remembered, those crimson petals spilled among the stones, would have called it simply murder. The sexual orchid that bloomed then sending so many  disinterested men to their graves has left its memory to a race of fools or heroes if silence is a virtue. The sea alone with its multiplicity holds any hope. The storm has proven abortive but we remain after the thoughts it roused to  re-cement our lives. It is the mind the mind that must be cured short of death's intervention, and the will becomes again a garden. The poem is complex and the place made in our lives for the poem. Silence can be complex too, but you do not get far with silence. Begin again. It is like Homer's catalogue of ships: it fills up the time. I speak in figures, well enough, the dresses you wear are figures also, we could not meet otherwise. When I speak of flowers it is to recall that at one time we were young. All women are not Helen, I know that, but have Helen in their hearts. My sweet, you have it also, therefore I love you and could not love you otherwise. Imagine you saw a field made up of women all silver-white. What should you do but love them? The storm bursts or fades! it is not the end of the world. Love is something else, or so I thought it, a garden which expands, though I knew you as a woman and never thought otherwise, until the whole sea has been taken up and all its gardens. It was the love of love, the love that swallows up all else, a grateful love, a love of nature, of people, of animals, a love engendering gentleness and goodness that moved me and that I saw in you. I should have known, though I did not, that the lily-of-the-valley is a flower makes many ill who whiff it. We had our children, rivals in the general onslaught. I put them aside though I cared for them. as well as any man could care for his children according to my lights. You understand I had to meet you after the event and have still to meet you. Love to which you too shall bow along with me- a flower a weakest flower shall be our trust and not because we are too feeble to do otherwise but because at the height of my power I risked what I had to do, therefore to prove that we love each other while my very bones sweated that I could not cry to you in the act. Of asphodel, that greeny flower, I come, my sweet, to sing to you! My heart rouses thinking to bring you news of something that concerns you and concerns many men. Look at what passes for the new. You will not find it there but in despised poems. It is difficult to get the news from poems yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there. Hear me out for I too am concerned and every man who wants to die at peace in his bed besides.I just saw two boys. One of them gets paid for distributing circulars and he throws it down the sewer.

It Thickens your blood. It stops your breath. It  Makes you feel dirty. You need a hot bath.  I leaned against a telephone pole, and watched. I thought I would die if she saw me.

The sons propped him. I saw the wedding. There were  Engraved invitations, it was so fashionable. I thought I would cry. I lay in bed that night And wondered if she would cry when something was done to her.  The mortgage was foreclosed. That last word was whispered.  She never came back. The family Sort of drifted off.

It was the season before the elderberry blooms, ThereforeSo hangs the hour like fruit fullblown and sweet, Our strict and desperate avatar, Despite that antique westward gulls lament Over enormous waters which retreat Weary unto the white and sensual star.

"Before you came, things were as they should be: the sky was the dead-end of sight, the road was just a road, wine merely wine.  Now everything is like my heart, a color at the edge of blood: the grey of your absence, the color of poison, of thorns, the gold when we meet, the season ablaze, the yellow of autumn, the red of flowers, of flames, and the black when you cover the earth with the coal of dead fires.  And the sky, the road, the glass of wine? The sky is a shirt wet with tears, the road a vein about to break, and the glass of wine a mirror in which the sky, the road, the world keep changing.  Don't leave now that you're here— Stay. So the world may become like itself again: so the sky may be the sky, the road a road, and the glass of wine not a mirror, just a glass of wine.This is the way that autumn came to the trees: it stripped them down to the skin, left their ebony bodies naked. It shook out their hearts, the yellow leaves, scattered them over the ground. Anyone could trample them out of shape undisturbed by a single moan of protest.  The birds that herald dreams were exiledWhen we launched life on the river of grief, how vital were our arms, how ruby our blood. With a few strokes, it seemed, we would cross all pain, we would soon disembark. That didn't happen. In the stillness of each wave we found invisible currents. The boatmen, too, were unskilled, their oars untested.   Since our lights were extinguished I have been searching for a way to see; my eyes are lost, God knows where.  You who know me, tell me who I am, who is a friend, and who an enemy. A murderous river has been unleashed into my veins; hatred beats in it.  Be patient; a flash of",Love

"As I walked out one evening,  Walking down Bristol Street, The crowds upon the pavement  Were fields of harvest wheat.  And down by the brimming river  I heard a lover sing Under an arch of the railway:  'Love has no ending.  'I'll love you, dear, I'll love you  Till China and Africa meet, And the river jumps over the mountain  And the salmon sing in the street,  'I'll love you till the ocean  Is folded and hung up to dry And the seven stars go squawking  Like geese about the sky.  'The years shall run like rabbits,  For in my arms I hold The Flower of the Ages,  And the first love of the world.'  But all the clocks in the city  Began to whirr and chime: 'O let not Time deceive you,  You cannot conquer Time.  'In the burrows of the Nightmare  Where Justice naked is, Time watches from the shadow  And coughs when you would kiss.  'In headaches and in worry  Vaguely life leaks away, And Time will have his fancy  To-morrow or to-day.  'Into many a green valley  Drifts the appalling snow; Time breaks the threaded dances  And the diver's brilliant bow.  'O plunge your hands in water,  Plunge them in up to the wrist; Stare, stare in the basin  And wonder what you've missed.  'The glacier knocks in the cupboard,  The desert sighs in the bed, And the crack in the tea-cup opens  A lane to the land of the dead.  'Where the beggars raffle the banknotes  And the Giant is enchanting to Jack, And the Lily-white Boy is a Roarer,  And Jill goes down on her back.  'O look, look in the mirror,  O look in your distress: Life remains a blessing  Although you cannot bless.  'O stand, stand at the window  As the tears scald and start; You shall love your crooked neighbour  With your crooked heart.'  It was late, late in the evening,  The lovers they were gone; The clocks had ceased their chiming,  And the deep river ran on.   She looked over his shoulder  For vines and olive trees,  Marble well-governed cities  And ships upon untamed seas,  But there on the shining metal  His hands had put instead  An artificial wilderness  And a sky like lead.  A plain without a feature, bare and brown,  NoOften I walk the dog at night. Once around the block, maybe twice, And sometimes we head up to the reservoir.

"Lay your sleeping head, my love, Human on my faithless arm; Time and fevers burn away Individual beauty from Thoughtful children, and the grave Proves the child ephemeral: But in my arms till break of day Let the living creature lie, Mortal, guilty, but to me The entirely beautiful.  Soul and body have no bounds: To lovers as they lie upon Her tolerant enchanted slope In their ordinary swoon, Grave the vision Venus sends Of supernatural sympathy, Universal love and hope; While an abstract insight wakes Among the glaciers and the rocks The hermit's carnal ecstasy.  Certainty, fidelity On the stroke of midnight pass Like vibrations of a bell, And fashionable madmen raise Their pedantic boring cry: Every farthing of the cost, All the dreaded cards foretell, Shall be paid, but from this night Not a whisper, not a thought, Not a kiss nor look be lost.  Beauty, midnight, vision dies: Let the winds of dawn that blow Softly round your dreaming head Such a day of welcome show Eye and knocking heart may bless, Find the mortal world enough; Noons of dryness find you fed By the involuntary powers, Nights of insult let you pass Watched by every human love.I sit in one of the dives On Fifty-second Street Uncertain and afraid As the clever hopes expire Of a low dishonest decade: Waves of anger and fear Circulate over the bright  And darkened lands of the earth, Obsessing our private lives; The unmentionable odour of death Offends the September night.  AccurateAmong pelagian travelers, Lost on their lewd conceited way To Massachusetts, Michigan, Miami or L.A.,  An airborne instrument I sit, Predestined nightly to fulfill Columbia-Giesen-Management's Unfathomable will,  By whose election justified, I bring my gospel of the Muse To fundamentalists, to nuns, to Gentiles  At the touch of you, As if you were an archer with your swift hand at the bow, The arrows of delight shot through my body.   You were spring, And I the edge of a cliff, And a shining waterfall rushed over me. ",Love

A candle in the thighs Warms youth and seed and burns the seeds of age; Where no seedNever until the mankind making Bird beast and flower Fathering and all humbling darkness Tells with silence the last light breaking  And the still hour Is come of the sea tumbling in harness  And I must enter again the round Zion of the water bead And the synagogue of the ear of corn Shall I let pray the shadowThe force that through the green fuse drives the flower Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees Is my destroyer.

"Your voice, with clear location of June days, Called me outside the window. You were there, Light yet composed, as in the just soft stare Of uncontested summer all things raise Plainly their seeming into seamless air.  Then your love looked as simple and entire As that picked pear you tossed me, and your face As legible as pearskin's fleck and trace, Which promise always wine, by mottled fire More fatal fleshed than ever human grace.  And your gay gift—Oh when I saw it fall Into my hands, through all that naïve light, It seemed as blessed with truth and new delight As must have been the first great gift of all.In her room at the prow of the house Where light breaks, and the windows are tossed with linden, My daughter is writing a story.  I pause in the stairwell, hearing From her shut door a commotion of typewriter-keys Like a chain hauled over a gunwale.  Young as she is, the stuff Of her life is a great cargo, andWhen you come, as you soon must, to the streets of our city, Mad-eyed from stating the obvious, Not proclaiming our fall but begging us In God's name to have self-pity,  Spare us all word of the weapons, their force and range, The long numbers that rocket the mind; Our slow, unreckoning hearts will be left behind",Love

Thus in winter stands the lonely tree,  Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,  Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:  I cannot say what loves have come and gone,  I only know that summer sang in me  A little while, that in me sings no more.I know what my heart is like  Since your love died: It is like a hollow ledge Holding a little pool  Left there by the tide,  A little tepid pool, Drying inward from the edge.Hearing your words, and not a word among them  Tuned to my liking, on a salty day  When inland woods were pushed by winds that flung them  Hissing to leeward like a ton of spray, I thought how off Matinicus the tide  Came pounding in, came running though the Gut,  While from the Rock the warning whistle cried,",Love
"While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead I played about the front gate, pulling flowers. You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse, You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums. And we went on living in the village of Chokan: Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.  At fourteen I married My Lord you. I never laughed, being bashful. Lowering my head, I looked at the wall. Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.  At fifteen I stopped scowling, I desired my dust to be mingled with yours Forever and forever and forever. Why should I climb the look out?  At sixteen you departed, You went into far Ku-to-yen, by the river of swirling eddies, And you have been gone five months. The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.  You dragged your feet when you went out. By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses, Too deep to clear them away! The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind. The paired butterflies are already yellow with August Over the grass in the West garden; They hurt me. I grow older.

No love is Like an ocean with the dizzy procession of the waves' boundaries From which two can emerge exhausted, nor long goodbye Like death. Coming at an end.

"I see the boys of summer in their ruin Lay the gold tithings barren, Setting no store by harvest, freeze the soils; There in their heat the winter floods Of frozen loves they fetch their girls, And drown the cargoed apples in their tides.  These boys of light are curdlers in their folly, Sour the boiling honey; The jacks of frost they finger in the hives; There in the sun the frigid threads Of doubt and dark they feed their nerves; The signal moon is zero in their voids.  I see the summer children in their mothers Split up the brawned womb's weathers, Divide the night and day with fairy thumbs; There in the deep with quartered shades Of sun and moon they paint their dams As sunlight paints the shelling of their heads.  I see that from these boys shall men of nothing Stature by seedy shifting, Or lame the air with leaping from its heats; There from their hearts the dogdayed pulse Of love and light bursts in their throats. O see the pulse of summer in the ice.But seasons must be challenged or they totter Into a chiming quarter Where, punctual as death, we ring the stars; There, in his night, the black-tongued bells The sleepy man of winter pulls, Nor blows back moon-and-midnight as she blows.

We summer boys in this four-winded spinning, Green of the seaweeds' iron, Hold up the noisy sea and drop her birds, Pick the world's ball of wave and froth To choke the deserts with her tides, And comb the county gardens for a wreath.  In spring we cross our foreheads with the holly, Heigh ho the blood and berry, And nail the merry squires to the trees; Here love's damp muscle dries and dies Here break a kiss in no love's quarry, O see the poles of promise in the boys.I see you boys of summer in your ruin. Man in his maggot's barren. And boys are full and foreign to the pouch. I am the man your father was. We are the sons of flint and pitch. O see the poles are kissing as they cross.

"Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.  And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:  When love beckons to you, follow him,  Though his ways are hard and steep.  And when his wings enfold you yield to him,  Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.  And when he speaks to you believe in him,  Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.   For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.  Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,  So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.  Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself  He threshes you to make your naked.  He sifts you to free you from your husks.  He grinds you to whiteness.  He kneads you until you are pliant;  And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast.   All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart.   But if in your heart you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure,  Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshing-floor,  Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.  Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.  Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;  For love is sufficient unto love.   When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”  And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.   Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.  But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:  To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.  To know the pain of too much tenderness.  To be wounded by your own understanding of love;  And to bleed willingly and joyfully.  To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;  To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy;  To return home at eventide with gratitude;  And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips. And a merchant said, Speak to us of Buying and Selling.  And he answered and said:  To you the earth yields her fruit, and you shall not want if you but know how to fill your hands.  It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and be satisfied.  Yet unless the exchangeThen a ploughman said, Speak to us of Work.

"Hearing your words, and not a word among them  Tuned to my liking, on a salty day  When inland woods were pushed by winds that flung them  Hissing to leeward like a ton of spray, I thought how off Matinicus the tide  Came pounding in, came running though the Gut,  While from the Rock the warning whistle cried,  And children whimpered and the doors blew shut;  There in the autumn when the men go forth, With slapping skirts the island women stand In gardens stripped and scattered, peering north,  With dahlia tubers dripping from the hand:  The wind of their endurance, driving south,  Flattened your words against your speaking mouth.Oh, oh, you will be sorry for that word! Give back my book and take my kiss instead.

"On summer afternoons I sit Quiescent by you in the park And idly watch the sunbeams gild And tint the ash-trees' bark.  Or else I watch the squirrels frisk And chaffer in the grassy lane; And all the while I mark your voice Breaking with love and pain.  I know a woman who would give Her chance of heaven to take my place; To see the love-light in your eyes, The love-glow on your face!  And there's a man whose lightest word Can set my chilly blood afire; Fulfillment of his least behest Defines my life’s desire.  But he will none of me, nor I Of you.

I, that had been to you, had you remained, But one more waking from a recurrent dream, Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained, And walk your memory's halls, austere, supreme, A ghost in marble of a girl you knew Who would have loved you in a day or two.To what purpose, April, do you return again?

Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far, My night shall be remembered for a star That outshone all the suns of all men's days. Shall I not crown them with immortal praise Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see The inenarrable godhead of delight?

Dear names, And thousand other throng to me! Royal flames; Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring; Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing; Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain, Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train; Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home; And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould; Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew; And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new; And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;— All these have been my loves. And these shall pass, Whatever passes not, in the great hour, Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power To hold them with me through the gate of Death. They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath, Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust And sacramented covenant to the dust. ——Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake, And give what's left of love again, and make New friends, now strangers. . . .

"I have been a spendthrift Dropping from lazy fingers Quiet coloured hours, Fluttering away from me Like oak and beech leaves in October.  I have lived keenly and wastefully, Like a bush or a sun insect— Lived sensually and thoughtfully, Loving the flesh and the beauty of this world— Green ivy about ruined towers, The out-pouring of the grey sea, And the ecstasy Of a pale clear sky at sunset.  I have been prodigal of love For cities and for lonely places; I have tried not to hate mankind; I have gathered sensations Like ripe fruits in a rich orchard… All this is gone; There are no leaves, no sea, No shade of a rich orchard, Only a sterile, dusty waste, Empty and threatening.

"When smoke stood up from Ludlow,  And mist blew off from Teme, And blithe afield to ploughing  Against the morning beam  I strode beside my team,  The blackbird in the coppice  Looked out to see me stride, And hearkened as I whistled  The trampling team beside,  And fluted and replied:  ‘Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;  What use to rise and rise? Rise man a thousand mornings  Yet down at last he lies,  And then the man is wise.’  I heard the tune he sang me,  And spied his yellow bill; I picked a stone and aimed it  And threw it with a will:  Then the bird was still.  Then my soul within me  Took up the blackbird’s strain, And still beside the horses  Along the dewy lane  It sang the song again:  ‘Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;  The sun moves always west; The road one treads to labour  Will lead one home to rest,  And that will be the best.’  REVEILLE  Wake: the silver dusk returning  Up the beach of darkness brims, And the ship of sunrise burning  Strands upon the eastern rims.

"On moonlit heath and lonesome bank  The sheep beside me graze; And yon the gallows used to clank  Fast by the four cross ways.

They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:  The whistles blow forlorn, And trains all night groan on the rail  To men that die at morn.

"   In the pleasant time of Pentecost,  By the little river Kyll, I followed the angler’s winding path  Or waded the stream at will, And the friendly fertile German land  Lay round me green and still.  But all day long on the eastern bank  Of the river cool and clear, Where the curving track of the double rails  Was hardly seen though near, The endless trains of German troops  Went rolling down to Trier.  They packed the windows with bullet heads  And caps of hodden gray; They laughed and sang and shouted loud  When the trains were brought to a stay; They waved their hands and sang again  As they went on their iron way.  No shadows fell on the smiling land,  No cloud arose in the sky; I could hear the river’s quiet tune  When the trains had rattled by; But my heart sank low with a heavy sense  Of trouble,—I knew not why.  Then came I into a certain field  Where the devil’s paint-brush spread ’Mid the gray and green of the rolling hills  A flaring splotch of red,— An evil omen, a bloody sign,  And a token of many dead.  I saw in a vision the field-gray horde  Break forth at the devil’s hour, And trample the earth into crimson mud  In the rage of the Will to Power,— All this I dreamed in the valley of Kyll,  At the sign of the blood-red flower.  “Lights out"" along the land, “Lights out” upon the sea.

"A saturated meadow,  Sun-shaped and jewel-small, A circle scarcely wider  Than the trees around were tall; Where winds were quite excluded,  And the air was stifling sweet With the breath of many flowers,—  A temple of the heat.

While the snow-drops still were sleeping  Beneath the silent sod; They felt their new life pulsing  Within the dark, cold clod.   Not a daffodil nor daisy  Had dared to raise its head; Not a fairhaired dandelion  Peeped timid from its bed;   Though a tremor of the winter  Did shivering through them run; Yet they lifted up their foreheads  To greet the vernal sun.   And the sunbeams gave them welcome,  As did the morning air— And scattered o’er their simple robes  Rich tints of beauty rare.   Soon a host of lovely flowers  From vales and woodland burst; But in all that fair procession  The crocuses were first.

" In these rapid, restless shadows,  Once I walked at eventide,  When a gentle, silent maiden,  Walked in beauty at my side  She alone there walked beside me  All in beauty, like a bride.   Pallidly the moon was shining  On the dewy meadows nigh;  On the silvery, silent rivers,  On the mountains far and high  On the ocean’s star-lit waters,  Where the winds a-weary die.   Slowly, silently we wandered  From the open cottage door,  Underneath the elm’s long branches  To the pavement bending o’er;  Underneath the mossy willow  And the dying sycamore.   With the myriad stars in beauty  All bedight, the heavens were seen,  Radiant hopes were bright around me,  Like the light of stars serene;  Like the mellow midnight splendor  Of the Night’s irradiate queen.   Audibly the elm-leaves whispered  Peaceful, pleasant melodies,  Like the distant murmured music  Of unquiet, lovely seas:  While the winds were hushed in slumber  In the fragrant flowers and trees.   Wondrous and unwonted beauty  Still adorning all did seem,  While I told my love in fables  ‘Neath the willows by the stream;  Would the heart have kept unspoken  Love that was its rarest dream!   Instantly away we wandered  In the shadowy twilight tide,  She, the silent, scornful maiden,  Walking calmly at my side,  With a step serene and stately,  All in beauty, all in pride.   Vacantly I walked beside her.  On the earth mine eyes were cast;  Swift and keen there came unto me  Ritter memories of the past  On me, like the rain in Autumn  On the dead leaves, cold and fast.   Underneath the elms we parted,  By the lowly cottage door;  One brief word alone was uttered  Never on our lips before;  And away I walked forlornly,  Broken-hearted evermore.   Slowly, silently I loitered,  Homeward, in the night, alone;  Sudden anguish bound my spirit,  That my youth had never known;  Wild unrest, like that which cometh  When the Night’s first dream hath flown.   Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper  Mad, discordant melodies,  And keen melodies like shadows  Haunt the moaning willow trees,  And the sycamores with laughter  Mock me in the nightly breeze.   Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight  Through the sighing foliage streams;  And each morning, midnight shadow,  Shadow of my sorrow seems;  Strive, 0 heart, forget thine idol!

But while I grow in a straight line, Still upwards bent, as if Heav’n were mine own,  Thy anger comes, and I decline: What frost to that? what pole is not the zone  Where all things burn,  When Thou dost turn,  And the least frown of Thine is shown?

" Kind solace in a dying hour!  Such, father, is not (now) my theme—  I will not madly deem that power  Of Earth may shrive me of the sin  Unearthly pride hath revell’d in—  I have no time to dote or dream:  You call it hope—that fire of fire!  It is but agony of desire:  If I can hope—Oh God! I can—  Its fount is holier—more divine—  I would not call thee fool, old man,  But such is not a gift of thine.   Know thou the secret of a spirit  Bow’d from its wild pride into shame.  O! yearning heart! I did inherit  Thy withering portion with the fame,  The searing glory which hath shone  Amid the jewels of my throne,  Halo of Hell! and with a pain  Not Hell shall make me fear again—  O! craving heart, for the lost flowers  And sunshine of my summer hours!  Th’ undying voice of that dead time,  With its interminable chime,  Rings, in the spirit of a spell,  Upon thy emptiness—a knell.   I have not always been as now:  The fever’d diadem on my brow  I claim’d and won usurpingly—  Hath not the same fierce heirdom given  Rome to the Caesar—this to me?  The heritage of a kingly mind,  And a proud spirit which hath striven  Triumphantly with human kind.   On mountain soil I first drew life:  The mists of the Taglay have shed  Nightly their dews upon my head,  And, I believe, the winged strife  And tumult of the headlong air  Have nestled in my very hair.   So late from Heaven—that dew—it fell  (Mid dreams of an unholy night)  Upon me—with the touch of Hell,  While the red flashing of the light  From clouds that hung, like banners, o’er,  Appeared to my half-closing eye  The pageantry of monarchy,  And the deep trumpet-thunder’s roar  Came hurriedly upon me, telling  Of human battle, where my voice,  My own voice, silly child!—was swelling  (O! how my spirit would rejoice,  And leap within me at the cry)  The battle-cry of Victory!   The rain came down upon my head  Unshelter’d—and the heavy wind  Was giantlike—so thou, my mind!—  It was but man, I thought, who shed  Laurels upon me: and the rush—  The torrent of the chilly air  Gurgled within my ear the crush  Of empires—with the captive’s prayer—  The hum of suiters—and the tone  Of flattery ‘round a sovereign’s throne.   My passions, from that hapless hour,  Usurp’d a tyranny which men  Have deem’d, since I have reach’d to power;  My innate nature—be it so:  But, father, there liv’d one who, then,  Then—in my boyhood—when their fire  Burn’d with a still intenser glow,  (For passion must, with youth, expire)  E’en then who knew this iron heart  In woman’s weakness had a part.   I have no words—alas!—to tell  The loveliness of loving well!  Nor would I now attempt to trace  The more than beauty of a face  Whose lineaments, upon my mind,  Are—shadows on th’ unstable wind:  Thus I remember having dwelt  Some page of early lore upon,  With loitering eye, till I have felt  The letters—with their meaning—melt  To fantasies—with none.   O, she was worthy of all love!  Love—as in infancy was mine—  ‘Twas such as angel minds above  Might envy; her young heart the shrine  On which my ev’ry hope and thought  Were incense—then a goodly gift,  For they were childish—and upright—  Pure—as her young example taught:  Why did I leave it, and, adrift,  Trust to the fire within, for light?   We grew in age—and love—together,  Roaming the forest, and the wild;  My breast her shield in wintry weather—  And, when the friendly sunshine smil’d,  And she would mark the opening skies,  I saw no Heaven—but in her eyes.   Young Love’s first lesson is—the heart:  For ‘mid that sunshine, and those smiles,  When, from our little cares apart,  And laughing at her girlish wiles,  I’d throw me on her throbbing breast,  And pour my spirit out in tears—  There was no need to speak the rest—  No need to quiet any fears  Of her—who ask’d no reason why,  But turn’d on me her quiet eye!   Yet more than worthy of the love  My spirit struggled with, and strove,  When, on the mountain peak, alone,  Ambition lent it a new tone—  I had no being—but in thee:  The world, and all it did contain  In the earth—the air—the sea—  Its joy—its little lot of pain  That was new pleasure—the ideal,  Dim, vanities of dreams by night—  And dimmer nothings which were real—  (Shadows—and a more shadowy light!)  Parted upon their misty wings,  And, so, confusedly, became  Thine image, and—a name—a name!  Two separate—yet most intimate things.   I was ambitious—have you known  The passion, father? You have not:  A cottager, I mark’d a throne  Of half the world as all my own,  And murmur’d at such lowly lot—  But, just like any other dream,  Upon the vapour of the dew  My own had past, did not the beam  Of beauty which did while it thro’   The minute—the hour—the day—oppress  My mind with double loveliness.   We walk’d together on the crown  Of a high mountain which look’d down  Afar from its proud natural towers  Of rock and forest, on the hills—  The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers  And shouting with a thousand rills.   I spoke to her of power and pride,  But mystically—in such guise  That she might deem it nought beside  The moment’s converse; in her eyes  I read, perhaps too carelessly—  A mingled feeling with my own—  The flush on her bright cheek, to me  Seem’d to become a queenly throne  Too well that I should let it be  Light in the wilderness alone.   I wrapp’d myself in grandeur then,  And donn’d a visionary crown—  Yet it was not that Fantasy  Had thrown her mantle over me—  But that, among the rabble—men,  Lion ambition is chain’d down—  And crouches to a keeper’s hand—  Not so in deserts where the grand  The wild—the terrible conspire  With their own breath to fan his fire.   Look ‘round thee now on Samarcand!—  Is not she queen of Earth? her pride  Above all cities? in her hand  Their destinies? in all beside  Of glory which the world hath known  Stands she not nobly and alone?  Falling—her veriest stepping-stone  Shall form the pedestal of a throne—  And who her sovereign? Timour—he  Whom the astonished people saw  Striding o’er empires haughtily  A diadem’d outlaw—   O! human love! thou spirit given,  On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!  Which fall’st into the soul like rain  Upon the Siroc wither’d plain,  And failing in thy power to bless  But leav’st the heart a wilderness!  Idea! which bindest life around  With music of so strange a sound  And beauty of so wild a birth—  Farewell! for I have won the Earth!   When Hope, the eagle that tower’d, could see  No cliff beyond him in the sky,  His pinions were bent droopingly—  And homeward turn’d his soften’d eye.  ‘Twas sunset: when the sun will part  There comes a sullenness of heart  To him who still would look upon  The glory of the summer sun.  That soul will hate the ev’ning mist,  So often lovely, and will list  To the sound of the coming darkness (known  To those whose spirits hearken) as one  Who, in a dream of night, would fly  But cannot from a danger nigh.   What tho’ the moon—the white moon  Shed all the splendour of her noon,  Her smile is chilly—and her beam,  In that time of dreariness, will seem  (So like you gather in your breath)  A portrait taken after death.  And boyhood is a summer sun  Whose waning is the dreariest one—  For all we live to know is known,  And all we seek to keep hath flown—  Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall  With the noon-day beauty—which is all.   I reach’d my home—my home no more—  For all had flown who made it so—  I pass’d from out its mossy door,  And, tho’ my tread was soft and low,  A voice came from the threshold stone  Of one whom I had earlier known—  O! I defy thee, Hell, to show  On beds of fire that burn below,  A humbler heart—a deeper wo—   Father, I firmly do believe—  I know—for Death, who comes for me  From regions of the blest afar,  Where there is nothing to deceive,  Hath left his iron gate ajar,  And rays of truth you cannot see  Are flashing thro’ Eternity—  I do believe that Eblis hath  A snare in ev’ry human path—  Else how, when in the holy grove  I wandered of the idol, Love,  Who daily scents his snowy wings  With incense of burnt offerings  From the most unpolluted things,  Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven  Above with trelliced rays from Heaven  No mote may shun—no tiniest fly  The light’ning of his eagle eye—  How was it that Ambition crept,  Unseen, amid the revels there,  Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt  In the tangles of Love’s very hair?  THOU wouldst be loved?—then let thy heart  From its present pathway part not!  Being everything which now thou art,  Be nothing which thou art not.  So with the world thy gentle ways,  Thy grace, thy more than beauty,  Shall be an endless theme of praise, Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow  Of crystal, wandering water,  Thou art an emblem of the glow  Of beauty—the unhidden heart—  The playful maziness of art  In old Alberto’s daughter;   But when within thy wave she looks—  Which glistens then, and Gaily bedight,  A gallant knight,  In sunshine and in shadow,  Had journeyed long,  Singing a song,  In search of Eldorado.

" Know ye the willow-tree  Whose gray leaves quiver,  Whispering gloomily  To yon pale river;  Lady, at even-tide  Wander not near it,  They say its branches hide  A sad, lost spirit?   Once to the willow-tree  A maid came fearful,  Pale seemed her cheek to be,  Her blue eye tearful;  Soon as she saw the tree,  Her step moved fleeter,  No one was there—ah me!  No one to meet her!

Softly the moon glints and glistens  As the water takes and leaves,  Like golden ears of corn  Which fall from loose-bound sheaves,   Or like the snow-white petals  Which drop from an overblown rose,  When Summer ripens to Autumn  And the freighted year must close.   From the shore come the scents of a garden,  And between a gap in the trees  A proud white statue glimmers  In cold, disdainful ease.

But the moon in her wayward beauty  Is ever and always the same,  As lovely as when upon Latmos  She watched till Endymion came.   Through the water the moon writes her legends  In light, on the smooth, wet sand;  They endure for a moment, and vanish,  And no one may understand.   All round us the secret of Nature  Is telling itself to our sight,  We may guess at her meaning but never  Can know the full mystery of night.

" On deck, beneath the awning,  I dozing lay and yawning;  It was the gray of dawning,  Ere yet the sun arose;  And above the funnel's roaring,  And the fitful wind's deploring,  I heard the cabin snoring  With universal nose.  I could hear the passengers snorting—  I envied their disporting—  Vainly I was courting  The pleasure of a doze!   So I lay, and wondered why light  Came not, and watched the twilight,  And the glimmer of the skylight,  That shot across the deck;  And the binnacle pale and steady,  And the dull glimpse of the dead-eye,  And the sparks in fiery eddy  That whirled from the chimney neck.  In our jovial floating prison  There was sleep from fore to mizzen,  And never a star had risen  The hazy sky to speck.   Strange company we harbored,  We'd a hundred Jews to larboard,  Unwashed, uncombed, unbarbered—  Jews black, and brown, and gray;  With terror it would seize ye,  And make your souls uneasy,  To see those Rabbis greasy,  Who did naught but scratch and pray:  Their dirty children puking—  Their dirty saucepans cooking—  Their dirty fingers hooking  Their swarming fleas away.   To starboard, Turks and Greeks were—  Whiskered and brown their cheeks were—  Enormous wide their breeks were,  Their pipes did puff alway;  Each on his mat allotted  In silence smoked and squatted,  Whilst round their children trotted  In pretty, pleasant play.  He can't but smile who traces  The smiles on those brown faces,  And the pretty, prattling graces  Of those small heathens gay.   And so the hours kept tolling,  And through the ocean rolling  Went the brave ""Iberia"" bowling  Before the break of day—   When A SQUALL, upon a sudden,  Came o'er the waters scudding;  And the clouds began to gather,  And the sea was lashed to lather,  And the lowering thunder grumbled,  And the lightning jumped and tumbled,  And the ship, and all the ocean,  Woke up in wild commotion.  Then the wind set up a howling,  And the poodle dog a yowling,  And the cocks began a crowing,  And the old cow raised a lowing,  As she heard the tempest blowing;  And fowls and geese did cackle,  And the cordage and the tackle  Began to shriek and crackle;  And the spray dashed o'er the funnels,  And down the deck in runnels;  And the rushing water soaks all,  From the seamen in the fo'ksal  To the stokers whose black faces  Peer out of their bed-places;  And the captain he was bawling,  And the sailors pulling, hauling,  And the quarter-deck tarpauling  Was shivered in the squalling;  And the passengers awaken,  Most pitifully shaken;  And the steward jumps up, and hastens  For the necessary basins.   Then the Greeks they groaned and quivered,  And they knelt, and moaned, and shivered,  As the plunging waters met them,  And splashed and overset them;  And they call in their emergence  Upon countless saints and virgins;  And their marrowbones are bended,  And they think the world is ended.   And the Turkish women for'ard  Were frightened and behorror'd;  And shrieking and bewildering,  The mothers clutched their children;  The men sung ""Allah! Illah!  Mashallah Bismillah!""  As the warring waters doused them  And splashed them and soused them,  And they called upon the Prophet,  And thought but little of it.   Then all the fleas in Jewry  Jumped up and bit like fury;  And the progeny of Jacob  Did on the main-deck wake up  (I wot those greasy Rabbins  Would never pay for cabins);  And each man moaned and jabbered in  His filthy Jewish gaberdine,  In woe and lamentation,  And howling consternation.  And the splashing water drenches  Their dirty brats and wenches;  And they crawl from bales and benches  In a hundred thousand stenches.   This was the White Squall famous,  Which latterly o'ercame us,  And which all will well remember  On the 28th September;  When a Prussian captain of Lancers  (Those tight-laced, whiskered prancers)  Came on the deck astonished,  By that wild squall admonished,  And wondering cried, ""Potztausend,  Wie ist der Strm jetzt brausend?""  And looked at Captain Lewis,  Who calmly stood and blew his  Cigar in all the hustle,  And scorned the tempest's tussle,  And oft we've thought thereafter  How he beat the storm to laughter;  For well he knew his vessel  With that vain wind could wrestle;  And when a wreck we thought her,  And doomed ourselves to slaughter,  How gayly he fought her,  And through the hubbub brought her,  And as the tempest caught her,  Cried, ""GEORGE! SOME BRANDY-AND-WATER!""   And when, its force expended,  The harmless storm was ended,  And as the sunrise splendid  Came blushing o'er the sea;  I thought, as day was breaking,  My little girls were waking,  And smiling, and making  A prayer at home for me.   1844.

" High up above the open, welcoming door  It hangs, a piece of wood with colours dim.  Once, long ago, it was a waving tree  And knew the sun and shadow through the leaves  Of forest trees, in a thick eastern wood.  The winter snows had bent its branches down,  The spring had swelled its buds with coming flowers,  Summer had run like fire through its veins,  While autumn pelted it with chestnut burrs,  And strewed the leafy ground with acorn cups.  Dark midnight storms had roared and crashed among  Its branches, breaking here and there a limb;  But every now and then broad sunlit days  Lovingly lingered, caught among the leaves.  Yes, it had known all this, and yet to us  It does not speak of mossy forest ways,  Of whispering pine trees or the shimmering birch;  But of quick winds, and the salt, stinging sea!  An artist once, with patient, careful knife,  Had fashioned it like to the untamed sea.  Here waves uprear themselves, their tops blown back  By the gay, sunny wind, which whips the blue  And breaks it into gleams and sparks of light.  Among the flashing waves are two white birds  Which swoop, and soar, and scream for very joy  At the wild sport. Now diving quickly in,  Questing some glistening fish. Now flying up,  Their dripping feathers shining in the sun,  While the wet drops like little glints of light,  Fall pattering backward to the parent sea.  Gliding along the green and foam-flecked hollows,  Or skimming some white crest about to break,  The spirits of the sky deigning to stoop  And play with ocean in a summer mood.  Hanging above the high, wide open door,  It brings to us in quiet, firelit room,  The freedom of the earth's vast solitudes,  Where heaping, sunny waves tumble and roll,  And seabirds scream in wanton happiness.

It widened a highway, majestic, stretching ever to distant horizons,  Where shadows of tree-branches wavered, vague outlines invaded by sunshine;  No sound but the wind as it whispered the secrets of earth to the flowers,  And the hum of the yellow bees, honey-laden and dusty with pollen.  And Summer said, ""Come, follow onward, with no thought save the longing  to wander,  The wind, and the bees, and the flowers, all singing the great song  of Nature,  Are minstrels of change and of promise, they herald the joy of the Future.""

I should’ve known the cliffs meant a coming blankness. We should’ve noticed the competition growing deadly between the masts and the trees. The problem wasn’t the lateness of our parties but what we used for wood to keep them lit.  What is it people say—take my arm and walk with me along the shore for a minute?   My mother, bless her, is a speck of color in the flush of a great cheek.  I’ve come to ask you to consider praying for that giant child.    Remember when we began to forget the babies once we tossed them in the air? First it was the completion of those simple gestures, but then entire sections of the story went missing. In our lips we could feel the slight buzz of the edge where the cut was made. We crawled in and out of those holes  wearing different faces.   I believe the stories got wet and began to bleed together.  I believe we built the sides of the town too high and the events kept rolling back.  I didn’t know that the water was going to keep rising as well,  but if you have any say in the matter, while the boats go down, I’d like to be on a ladder, peeking into a loft made narcotic with children,  a dead pool with rolling, living waves. If possible,  I’d like the water to douse the match that’s growing out of the bones of my hand. What is red and singing on the inside, gray and moaning on the outside?

I see myself as a child again, feel the unknown  rhythm of times past:  I a dream I am lying on a girl stuck in my heart: a musical bas-relief for vast infinity: I compare her to the moon, to the stars, to the splendorous night and everything attaches me to that love I lose myself in: of this I actually know nothing except a confusing clamor.     Lucciole bionde per le siepi d’estate, com’è splendido il vostro raggio che per le tenebra appare! Voi mi ricordate qualcosa che non si annulla della mia fanciullezza: infinita speranza pei prati. Mi rivedo fanciullo, sento l’ignota cadenza di tempi andati: sono in sogno sopra una fanciulla  che mi s’è fitta in cuore: un bassorilievo musicale per estese infinità: la paragono alla luna, alle stelle, allo splendore della notte e tutto mi affiso in quell’amore e mi vi disperdo: di qui non so nulla ",Nature

"It didn't weep the way a willow should. Planted all alone in the middle of the field by the bachelor who sold our house to us, shoulder height when our daughter was born, it grew eight feet a year until it blocked the view through the first-, then the second- story windows, its straggly canopy obstructing our sunrise and moonrise over Max Gray Road. I gave it the evil eye, hoping lightning would strike it, the way a bolt had split the butternut by the barn. And if leaf blight or crown gall or cankers didn’t kill it, then I'd gladly pay someone to chop it down. My daughter said no, she loved that tree, and my husband agreed. One wet Sunday— the rainiest July since 1885— husband napping, daughter at a matinee in town—a wind shear barreled up the hill so loud I glanced up from my mystery the moment the willow leaned, bowed, and fell over flat on its back, roots and all, splayed on the ground like Gulliver. The house shook, just once. Later, when the sun came out, neighbors came to gawk; they chain-sawed thicker branches, wrapped chains around the trunk, their backhoe ripped out pieces of stump and root as if extracting a rotten tooth. I'm not sorry that tree is gone. No one ever sat under it for shade or contemplation. Yet spring after spring it reliably leafed out. It was always the last to lose its leaves in fall. It should have died a decade ago for all the grief I gave it, my dirty looks apparently the fuel on which it thrived. It must have done its weeping in private. But now I can see the slope of the hill. Did my wishful thinking cast a spell? I was the only one on earth who saw it fall.",Nature
"Our heart wanders lost in the dark woods. Our dream wrestles in the castle of doubt. But there's music in us. Hope is pushed down but the angel flies up again taking us with her. The summer mornings begin inch by inch while we sleep, and walk with us later as long-legged beauty through the dirty streets. It is no surprise  that danger and suffering surround us. What astonishes is the singing. We know the horses are there in the dark meadow because we can smell them, can hear them breathing.  Our spirit persists like a man struggling  through the frozen valley who suddenly smells flowers and realizes the snow is melting out of sight on top of the mountain, knows that spring has begun.We find out the heart only by dismantling what the heart knows. By redefining the morning, we find a morning that comes just after darkness. We can break through marriage into marriage.

The rising wind pulls you out of it, and you look up to see a cloud of leaves wheeling in sunlight, flickering against the blue and lifting above the treetops, as if the whole day were sighing, .Love is enough: though the World be a-waning, And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining,  Though the sky be too dark for dim eyes to discover The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder, Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder  And this day draw aListen. . .

"I woke up real early to write about death (the lake through the trees) from the angle of the angel. There's the kind of angel that when I say .—well, it comes running & tackles me and oh, it's divine football—Or in the dream when the transparent buses  came barreling towards us:—it was there. Half of all Americans say  they believe in angels. And why shouldn't they. If someone swoops in to tell them how death's a fuzzy star that's full of bugles, well it's a hell of a lot better than what they see on TV: the surf much too warm for December, and rollercoasters full of the wounded and the subconscious that keep pulling in—Who wants to believe  death's just another life inside a box, tale-pale or more vivid? Not me. Like in , when they showed the cypresses flanking the end-road——of course I cried. Show me a cypress and I'll just go off, but I don't want to be . Or some kind of poem you can never find your way out of! And sometimes  I think I nod at the true death: when from a moving train I see a house in the morning sun and it casts a shadow on the ground, an inquiry and I think ""Crisp inquiry"" & go on to work, perfumed of it—that's the kind of death I'm talking about.  An angle of light. Believe in it. I believe in the light and disorder of the word repeated until quote Meaning unquote leeches out of it. And that's what I wanted to do with dame Death, for you: repeat it until you're all, What? D-E-A-T-H? 'Cause Amy that's all it is, a word, material in the way the lake through the trees is material, that is: insofar, not at all. Because we haven't yet swam in it. See what I mean? I see death, I smell death, it moves the hair on my face but  I don't know where it blows from. And in its sources is my power. I'm incredibly powerful in my ignorance. I'm incredible, like some kind of fuzzy star. The nonsense of me is the nonsense of death, and Oh look! Light through the trees on the lake:  the lake has the kind of calmness my pupils' surface believes...and this is just the thing that the boxed land of shades at the end of the remote doesn't program for: the lake is so kind to me, Amy, and I'll be so kind to you, Amy, and so we'll never die: there'll be plenty of us around to  keep casting our inquiry  against the crisp light. Light is all like, what's up, I'm here I'm an angel! & we're all: no you're not, that doesn't exist. We all laugh and laugh...  Or cry and cry. The point is, it's words, and so's death. Even in that silence there's bird calls or meteors or something hurtling through space: there's matter and light. I've seen it through the theater of the trees and it was beautiful  It cut my eyes and I didn't even care  I already had the seeing taken care of. Even in the months I didn't have a single poem in me, I had this death and this love, and how's that not enough? I even have a quote: , di Prima.Skinny dirt road In the middle of the ocean. That led to the house of art. I took it. The engine nearly Drowned. I lied that it was fun That I'd do it again. When I got to That shore The house was gone and when I looked back, so was the path.

"The ground cracked like the rough pit of a peach and snapped in two. The sun behind the mountains turned into an olive-green glow.  To niña Gloria this was home. She continued to sell her bowl of lemons, rubbing a cold, thin silver Christ pocketed in her apron. Others  like Lito and Marvin played  soldiers in the ruins of a school, running around mounds of bricks,  shooting chickens and pigs.  No one knows exactly how a light film of ash appeared on everyone’s eyelids early in the morning or how trout and mackerel plunged from the sky, twitched, leaped through the streets.  Some say the skin of trees felt like old newspaper, dry and yellow. Others believe the soapsuds washed aside in rivers began to rise in their milk.  One Monday morning, a rain fell  and the cemetery washed into the city. Bones began to knock  and knock at our doors. Streets became muddy rivers waiting for bodies to drop  among piles of dead fish.  In a year, everyone stabbed flowers on a grave.  This explains why women thought  and moved like lizards under stones, why men heard bees buzzing inside their skulls, why dogs lost their sense of smell sniffing piles of rubble to get back home.   In a few years, no one cared  about turtles banging their heads against rocks, bulls with their sad, busted eyes, parrots that kept diving into creeks, the dark swelling of the open ground or at night a knife stained the kitchen cloth.

But he thought a big thought—I could tell by his eye—  Which being expressed, might be this in effect:  'I have left those there berries, I shrewdly suspect,  To ripen too long. I am greatly to blame.'""    ""He's a thriftier person than some I could name.""    ""He seems to be thrifty; and hasn't he need,  With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed?  He has brought them all up on wild berries, they say,  Like birds. They store a great many away.  They eat them the year round, and those they don't eat  They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet.""    ""Who cares what they say? It's a nice way to live,  Just taking what Nature is willing to give,  Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow.""    ""I wish you had seen his perpetual bow—  And the air of the youngsters! Not one of them turned,  And they looked so solemn-absurdly concerned.""    ""I wish I knew half what the flock of them know  Of where all the berries and other things grow,  Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top  Of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop.  I met them one day and each had a flower  Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower;  Some strange kind—they told me it hadn't a name.""    ""I've told you how once not long after we came,  I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth  By going to him of all people on earth  To ask if he knew any fruit to be had  For the picking. The rascal, he said he'd be glad  To tell if he knew. But the year had been bad.  There had been some berries—but those were all gone.  He didn't say where they had been. He went on:  'I'm sure—I'm sure'—as polite as could be.  He spoke to his wife in the door, 'Let me see,  Mame, we don't know any good berrying place?'  It was all he could do to keep a straight face.    ""If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him,  He'll find he's mistaken. See here, for a whim,  We'll pick in the Mortensons' pasture this year.  We'll go in the morning, that is, if it's clear,  And the sun shines out warm: the vines must be wet.  It's so long since I picked I almost forget  How we used to pick berries: we took one look round,  Then sank out of sight like trolls underground,  And saw nothing more of each other, or heard,  Unless when you said I was keeping a bird  Away from its nest, and I said it was you.  'Well, one of us is.' For complaining it flew  Around and around us. And then for a while  We picked, till I feared you had wandered a mile,  And I thought I had lost you. I lifted a shout  Too loud for the distance you were, it turned out,  For when you made answer, your voice was as low  As talking—you stood up beside me, you know.""    ""We sha'n't have the place to ourselves to enjoy—  Not likely, when all the young Lorens deploy.  They'll be there to-morrow, or even to-night.  They won't be too friendly—they may be polite—  To people they look on as having no right  To pick where they're picking. But we won't complain.  You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain,  The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves,  Like two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves.""A house that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master,  With doors that none but the wind ever closes, Its floor all littered with glass and with plaster;  It stands in a garden of old-fashioned roses.

Blank summer’s surfeit heaves in mist; Dumb earth basks dewy-washed; while still We whom Intelligence has kissed Do make us shackles of our will. And yet I know in each loud brain, Round-clamped with laws and learning so, Is madness more and lust of strain Than earth’s jerked godlings e’er can know The false Delilah of our brain Has set us round the millstone going. O lust of roving! lust of pain! Our hair will not be long in growing. Like blinded Samson round we go. We hear the grindstone groan and cry. Yet we are kings, we know, we know. What shall we do? How shall we die? Take but our pauper’s gift of birth, O let us from the grindstone free! And tread the maddening gladdening earth In strength close-braced with purity. The earth is old; we ever new. Our eyes should see no other sense Than this eternally to DO— Our joy, our task, our recompense; Up unexploréd mountains move, Track tireless through great wastes afar, Nor slumber in the arms of love Nor tremble on the brink of war; Make Beauty and make Rest give place, Mock Prudence loud—and she is gone, Smite Satisfaction on the face And tread the ghost of Ease upon.

" (For Edward J. Wheeler)  Within the Jersey City shed The engine coughs and shakes its head. The smoke, a plume of red and white, Waves madly in the face of night. And now the grave incurious stars Gleam on the groaning hurrying cars. Against the kind and awful reign Of darkness, this our angry train, A noisy little rebel, pouts Its brief defiance, flames and shouts— And passes on, and leaves no trace. For darkness holds its ancient place, Serene and absolute, the king Unchanged, of every living thing. The houses lie obscure and still In Rutherford and Carlton Hill. Our lamps intensity the dark Of slumbering Passaic Park. And quiet holds the weary feet That daily tramp through Prospect Street. What though we clang and clank and roar Through all Passaic’s streets? No door Will open, not an eye will see Who this loud vagabond may be. Upon my crimson cushioned seat, In manufactured light and heat, I feel unnatural and mean. Outside the towns are cool and clean; Curtained awhile from sound and sight They take God’s gracious gift of night. The stars are watchful over them. On Clifton as on Bethlehem The angels, leaning down the sky, Shed peace and gentle dreams. And I— I ride, I blasphemously ride Through all the silent countryside. The engine’s shriek, the headlight’s glare, Pollute the still nocturnal air. The cottages of Lake View sigh And sleeping, frown as we pass by. Why, even strident Paterson Rests quietly as any nun. Her foolish warring children keep The grateful armistice of sleep. For what tremendous errand’s sake Are we so blatantly awake? What precious secret is our freight? What king must be abroad so late? Perhaps Death roams the hills to-night And we rush forth to give him fight. Or else, perhaps, we speed his way To come remote unthinking prey. Perhaps a woman writhes in pain And listens—listens for the train! The train, with healing on its wings. Now “Hawthorne!” the conductor cries. My neighbor starts and rubs his eyes. He hurries yawning through the car And steps out where the houses are. This is the reason of our quest! Not wantonly we break the rest Of town and village, nor do we Lightly profane night’s sanctity. What Love commands the train fulfills, And beautiful upon the hills Are these our feet of burnished steel. Subtly and certainly I feel That Glen Rock welcomes us to her And silent Ridgewood seems to stir And smile, because she knows the train Has brought her children back again. We carry people home—and so  God speeds us, wheresoe’er we go. Hohokus, Waldwick, Allendale Lift sleepy heads to give us hail. In Ramsey, Mahwah, Suffern stand Houses that wistfully demand A father—son—some human thing That this, the midnight train, may bring. The trains that travel in the day They hurry folks to work or play. The midnight train is slow and old, But of it let this thing be told, To its high honor be it said, It carries people home to bed. My cottage lamp shines white and clear. God bless the train that brought me here. I think that I shall never see  A poem lovely as a tree.    A tree whose hungry mouth is prest  Against the sweet earth's flowing breast;    A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray;    A tree that may in summer wear  A nest of robins in her hair;    Upon whose  Because the road was steep and long  And through a dark and lonely land, God set upon my lips a song  And put a lantern in my hand.  Through miles on weary miles of night  That stretch relentless in my way My lantern burns serene and white,  An unexhausted cup of day.  O goldenLed by a star, a golden star, The youngest star, an olden star, Here the kings and the shepherds are, Akneeling on the ground. What did they come to the inn to see?

"On moonlit heath and lonesome bank  The sheep beside me graze; And yon the gallows used to clank  Fast by the four cross ways.  A careless shepherd once would keep  The flock by moonlight there, And high amongst the glimmering sheep  The dead man stood on air.  They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:  The whistles blow forlorn, And trains all night groan on the rail  To men that die at morn.  There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to-night,  Or wakes, as may betide, A better lad, if things went right,  Than most that sleep outside.  And naked to the hangman’s noose  The morning clocks will ring A neck God made for other use  Than strangling in a string.

But I’m over 40 now & live alone, & if I don’t remember it's Thursday & rise with the cardinals & bluejays calling up the sun, I’m stuck with what’s left rotting for another week.   I swing my legs like anchors over the side of the bed & use the wall for leverage to stand, shuffle to the bathroom. In summer, I slide into a pair of shorts & flip flops, wandering room to room to collect what no longer serves me.   I shimmy the large kitchen bag from the steel canister, careful not to spill what’s inside or rip it somehow & gross myself out. Sometimes I double bag for insurance, tying loose ends together, cinching it tightly for the journey.   Still combing through webs of dreams, of spiders’ handiwork glistening above the wheeled container on the back patio, I drag my refuse down the driveway past the chrysanthemums & azaleas, the huge Magnolia tree shading the living room from Georgia’s heat, flattening hordes of unsuspecting ants in my path to park it next to the mailbox for merciful elves to take off my hands.   It is not lost on me that one day someone responsible, someone who loves me enough will dispose of this worn, wrinkled container after my spirit soars on.

""Ned drives about in buggies,  Tom sometimes takes a 'bus;  Ah, cruel fate, why made you  My children differ thus?  Why make of Tom a DULLARD,  And Ned a GENIUS?""   ""You'll cut him with a shilling,""  Exclaimed the man of wits:  ""I'll leave my wealth,"" said Brentford,  ""Sir Lawyer, as befits;  And portion both their fortunes  Unto their several wits.""   ""Your Grace knows best,"" the lawyer said  ""On your commands I wait.""  ""Be silent, Sir,"" says Brentford,  ""A plague upon your prate!  Come take your pen and paper,  And write as I dictate.""   The will as Brentford spoke it  Was writ and signed and closed;  He bade the lawyer leave him,  And turn'd him round and dozed;  And next week in the churchyard  The good old King reposed.   Tom, dressed in crape and hatband,  Of mourners was the chief;  In bitter self-upbraidings  Poor Edward showed his grief:  Tom hid his fat white countenance  In his pocket-handkerchief.   Ned's eyes were full of weeping,  He falter'd in his walk;  Tom never shed a tear,  But onwards he did stalk,  As pompous, black, and solemn,  As any catafalque.   And when the bones of Brentford—  That gentle king and just—  With bell and book and candle  Were duly laid in dust,  ""Now, gentleman,"" says Thomas,  ""Let business be discussed.   ""When late our sire beloved  Was taken deadly ill,  Sir Lawyer, you attended him  (I mean to tax your bill);  And, as you signed and wrote it,  I prithee read the will.""   The lawyer wiped his spectacles,  And drew the parchment out;  And all the Brentford family  Sat eager round about:  Poor Ned was somewhat anxious,  But Tom had ne'er a doubt.   ""My son, as I make ready  To seek my last long home,  Some cares I had for Neddy,  But none for thee, my Tom:  Sobriety and order  You ne'er departed from.   ""Ned hath a brilliant genius,  And thou a plodding brain;  On thee I think with pleasure,  On him with doubt and pain.""  ""You see, good Ned,"" says Thomas,  ""What he thought about us twain.""   ""Though small was your allowance,  You saved a little store;  And those who save a little  Shall get a plenty more.""  As the lawyer read this compliment,  Tom's eyes were running o'er.   ""The tortoise and the hare, Tom,  Set out, at each his pace;  The hare it was the fleeter,  The tortoise won the race;  And since the world's beginning  This ever was the case.   ""Ned's genius, blithe and singing,  Steps gayly o'er the ground;  As steadily you trudge it  He clears it with a bound;  But dulness has stout legs, Tom,  And wind that's wondrous sound.   ""O'er fruits and flowers alike, Tom,  You pass with plodding feet;  You heed not one nor t'other  But onwards go your beat,  While genius stops to loiter  With all that he may meet;   ""And ever as he wanders,  Will have a pretext fine  For sleeping in the morning,  Or loitering to dine,  Or dozing in the shade,  Or basking in the shine.   ""Your little steady eyes, Tom,  Though not so bright as those  That restless round about him  His flashing genius throws,  Are excellently suited  To look before your nose.   ""Thank heaven, then, for the blinkers  It placed before your eyes;  The stupidest are weakest,  The witty are not wise;  Oh, bless your good stupidity,  It is your dearest prize!   ""And though my lands are wide,  And plenty is my gold,  Still better gifts from Nature,  My Thomas, do you hold—  A brain that's thick and heavy,  A heart that's dull and cold.   ""Too dull to feel depression,  Too hard to heed distress,  Too cold to yield to passion  Or silly tenderness.  March on—your road is open  To wealth, Tom, and success.   ""Ned sinneth in extravagance,  And you in greedy lust.""  (""I' faith,"" says Ned, ""our father  Is less polite than just."")  ""In you, son Tom, I've confidence,  But Ned I cannot trust.   ""Wherefore my lease and copyholds,  My lands and tenements,  My parks, my farms, and orchards,  My houses and my rents,  My Dutch stock and my Spanish stock,  My five and three per cents,   ""I leave to you, my Thomas—""  (""What, all?"" poor Edward said.  ""Well, well, I should have spent them,  And Tom's a prudent head."")—  ""I leave to you, my Thomas,—  To you in TRUST for Ned.""   The wrath and consternation  What poet e'er could trace  That at this fatal passage  Came o'er Prince Tom his face;  The wonder of the company,  And honest Ned's amaze!   ""'Tis surely some mistake,""  Good-naturedly cries Ned;  The lawyer answered gravely,  ""'Tis even as I said;  'Twas thus his gracious Majesty  Ordain'd on his death-bed.   ""See, here the will is witness'd,  And here's his autograph.""  ""In truth, our father's writing,""  Says Edward, with a laugh;  ""But thou shalt not be a loser, Tom,  We'll share it half and half.""   ""Alas! my kind young gentleman,  This sharing cannot be;  'Tis written in the testament  That Brentford spoke to me,  'I do forbid Prince Ned to give  Prince Tom a halfpenny.   ""'He hath a store of money,  But ne'er was known to lend it;  He never help'd his brother;  The poor he ne'er befriended;  He hath no need of property  Who knows not how to spend it.   ""'Poor Edward knows but how to spend,  And thrifty Tom to hoard;  Let Thomas be the steward then,  And Edward be the lord;  And as the honest laborer  Is worthy his reward,   ""'I pray Prince Ned, my second son,  And my successor dear,  To pay to his intendant  Five hundred pounds a year;  And to think of his old father,  And live and make good cheer.'""   Such was old Brentford's honest testament,  He did devise his moneys for the best,  And lies in Brentford church in peaceful rest.  Prince Edward lived, and money made and spent;  But his good sire was wrong, it is confess'd  To say his son, young Thomas, never lent.  He did. Young Thomas lent at interest,  And nobly took his twenty-five per cent.   Long time the famous reign of Ned endured  O'er Chiswick, Fulham, Brentford, Putney, Kew,  But of extravagance he ne'er was cured.  And when both died, as mortal men will do,  'Twas commonly reported that the steward  Was very much the richer of the two.

No rays from the holy heaven come down  On the long night-time of that town;  But light from out the lurid sea  Streams up the turrets silently—  Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—  Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—  Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—  Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers  Of scultured ivy and stone flowers—  Up many and many a marvellous shrine  Whose wreathed friezes intertwine  The viol, the violet, and the vine.

"The Blue Dress—died on August 6, 2015, along with the little blue flowers,  all silent. Once the petals looked up.  Now small pieces of dust.

" After Shiloh, with smoke still scumbling the air, the artist paced away from the sunken road where a full brigade had been strafed and decimated. The flies had begun to swarm, lighting on the eyes and open wounds of the fallen, the stench already gut-wrenching, heartrending, as were the groans of injured pack animals weighted down by tack and baggage, as well as that last shadow beasts can divine,  but the artist spread out his charcoals and chalk on a blue blanket and leaned against the trunk of a smoking blackjack pine. The Rebel rear guard occasionally launched a volley, as Federal cooks gathered wood to ready the mess in case any survivors could muster a hunger.  Stroke by stroke, the draftsman began his sketch, three peaches slowly forming, their delicacy almost sexual, shade and shadow, amplitudes unblemished, colors of dawn fire and sunset, the fuzz nearly palpable enough to make the skin itch, scent so nearly visceral my tongue and lips went moist whispering, Peach.  An Illinois corporal peering over the artist’s shoulder broke his silence to say, “Fellow, can’t you see all them soldiers blown apart or in pain right here? How the hell can you ignore the horses, the jack mules, that wagon yonder still in flames? Peaches, what the hell?”  But the correspondent kept his focus, summoning the delicious, the elegant repose in earshot of the surgeon’s tent, the work of the saw and the miserable screaming, where the faces of casualties were twisted and hideous. Orderlies splattered in blood rushed about weeping. An officer with an eye badly patched oversaw the burial detail spading dirt into the trench already filling with scrapped bandages and grisly limbs. “‘Still life,’ we art makers say,” was the sketch artist’s answer, “meaning both ‘motionless’ and ‘not yet dead,’ though the phase after ripeness is not so lovely, and the pit clenched in the fruit’s core is redder than carnage, rougher than your musket balls, a full bore .54 caliber, if I reckon correctly.”  And then he looked from the soldier’s angry eyes to the empty sky before he resumed.  “Peaches, maybe, are what I need to see, what my weary heart yearns to remember. Better than any green shoots or delicate petals, better than family toasts and a sister deft at the piano, I know the bloodbath we inhabit, sir, against which I can offer only a fragile moment as counterpoint to our surround.

"“Just as [William] Blake saw the world in ‘a grain of sand,’ with oppositional force, I try to capture the world’s injustice in one temporal ‘Chinese American quatrain.’  The first piece is comprised of two classic call-and-response quatrains. The first voice offers an argument and the second voice counters it. In the second piece I employ what I call the ‘cruel juxtaposition’ strategy. I juxtapose the history of oppression against women by using disturbing elliptical images of the dead mother’s body parts against a reference to Basho’s famous frog poem, which describes the perfect Zen distilled moment. Two heavy incongruous ideas happening on one tiny lotus pad. The third piece offers a cruel juxtaposition self-consciously contrasting an entitled American poet’s easy life against those of dying boys in a faraway war.

It takes years to notice I’m wondering and then years to think of speaking it, then one day I sit down to write poetry and somehow say it. It’s great because now I can think about it more vividly.

There's the kind of angel that when I say .—well, it comes running & tackles me and oh, it's divine football—Or in the dream when the transparent buses  came barreling towards us:—it was there. Half of all Americans say  they believe in angels. And why shouldn't they. If someone swoops in to tell them how death's a fuzzy star that's full of bugles, well it's a hell of a lot better than what they see on TV: the surf much too warm for December, and rollercoasters full of the wounded and the subconscious that keep pulling in—Who wants to believe  death's just another life inside a box, tale-pale or more vivid?

'Cause Amy that's all it is, a word, material in the way the lake through the trees is material, that is: insofar, not at all. Because we haven't yet swam in it. See what I mean? I see death, I smell death, it moves the hair on my face but  I don't know where it blows from. And in its sources is my power. I'm incredibly powerful in my ignorance. I'm incredible, like some kind of fuzzy star. The nonsense of me is the nonsense of death, and Oh look! Light through the trees on the lake:  the lake has the kind of calmness my pupils' surface believes...and this is just the thing that the boxed land of shades at the end of the remote doesn't program for: the lake is so kind to me, Amy, and I'll be so kind to you, Amy, and so we'll never die: there'll be plenty of us around to  keep casting our inquiry  against the crisp light. Light is all like, what's up, I'm here I'm an angel! & we're all: no you're not, that doesn't exist. We all laugh and laugh...  Or cry and cry. The point is, it's words, and so's death. Even in that silence there's bird calls or meteors or something hurtling through space: there's matter and light. I've seen it through the theater of the trees and it was beautiful  It cut my eyes and I didn't even care  I already had the seeing taken care of.

The body is the Defeat of dreams spread out long and empty (if you shout, you hear the echo) with its anemic tiny hairs unloved by time wounded, sobbing hating its own motion its original black color fades steadily when it wakes it clasps its bag hanging on to pain for hours in the dust.  The body is the Victory of dreams when it puts one foot in front of the other and gains a certain ground. A place.  With a heavy thump. Death. When the body gains a place in a town square after death like a wolf with a burning snout it howls, ""I want it"" ""I can't stand it"" ""I threaten—I revolt"" ""My baby is hungry.""  The body gives birth to justice and its defense. The body creates the flower spits out the death-pit tumbles over, takes flight spins motionless around the cesspool (the world's motion) in dreams the body triumphs of finds itself naked in the streets in pain;  it loses its teeth shivers from love breaks its earth open  like a watermelon and is done.",Death
" – Zen admonition    1. About the Dead Man and Fungi  The dead man has changed his mind about moss and mold. About mildew and yeast. About rust and smut, about soot and ash. Whereas once he turned from the sour and the decomposed, now he breathes deeply in the underbelly  of the earth. Of mushrooms, bakers yeast, fungi of wood decay, and the dogs preceding their masters to the  burnt acre of morels. And the little seasonals themselves, stuck on their wobbly pin stems.  For in the pan they float without crisping. For they are not without a hint of the sublime, nor the curl of a hand. These are the caps and hairdos, the mini-umbrellas, the zeppelins of a world in which human  beings are heavy-footed mammoths. Puffballs and saucers, recurrent, recumbent, they fill the encyclopedia. Not wrought for the pressed eternity of flowers or butterflies. Loners and armies alike appearing overnight at the point of return. They live fast, they die young, they will be back.   2. More About the Dead Man and Fungi  Fruit of the fungi, a mushroom's birthing is an arrow from below. It is because of Zeno's Paradox that one cannot get there by half-measures. It is the fault of having anything else to do. The dead man prefers the mushroom of the gatherer to that of the farmer. Gilled or ungilled, stemmed or stemless, woody or leathery, the mushroom is secretive, yes, by  nature. Each mushroom was a button, each a flowering, some glow in the dark. Medicinal or toxic, each was lopped from the stump of eternity. The dead man has seen them take the shapes of cups and saucers, of sponges, logs and bird nests.  The dead man probes the shadows, he fingers the crannies and undersides, he spots the mushroom  underfoot just in time. When the dead man saw a mushrooming cloud above Hiroshima, he knew. He saw that death was beautiful from afar. He saw that nature is equidistant from the nourishing and the poisonous, the good and the bad,  the beginning and the end. He knew the littlest mushroom, shivering on its first day, was a signal.You are not beautiful, exactly. You are beautiful, inexactly.

" – Zen admonition    1. About the Dead Man and the Foundry  The dead man hath founded the dead man's foundry. He acted in the past perfect, he funded it with clean dirt, pure water and the spotless air. Then he was melted, he was molded, he was poured and shook out. He was ground and sanded, he was machined to a sweet tolerance. The dead man took pains to stay alive, this was how. It was the undersong of the self, the subtext, the no-man's-land's calling. For the dead man was subterranean to start. He was the tuber in the sun, the worm warming, the root that stays put. The dead man became again what he was, he germinated. It was the foundry of the sun, the foundry of the earth's core, the foundry of the electric  light and the dry cell. It was the retrofit energy that did it, the assemblage after dispersion, the kick in the  pants we call chaos. We are the children of a hothouse, among orchids that grow in lava.    2. More About the Dead Man and the Foundry  The foundry of the dead man pops and smolders with re-creation. It is recreated in the titanic and the miniature, every detail. Within the dead man, the same fire burns. The same furnace, the same raw materials that made flesh. The same red water, the same liquid sinew cooling. The dead man's foundry has made weapons and ploughshares, and those who use them. The foundry and the forge, the shapes imprisoned in the molten streams of rough matter,  these are precursors of the human, too. The steam escaping from a wounded body is the foundry. The heat of exhalation, the blush of desire, the red sun under the skin—they are the foundry. And the high temperature of the ill, and the heat of the first foundry reassembling at its  source. If you believe in the reformation of energy, then you believe as well in the dead man. He is heating up, and what is emotion?Being red is the color of a white sun where it lingers on an arm. Color of time lost in sparks, of space lost inside dance. Red of walks by the railroad in the flush of youth, while our steps released the squeaks of shoots reaching for the light.

" – Zen admonition    1. About the Dead Man and Your Hands  Mornings, he keeps out the world awhile, the dead man. The dead man, without looking, believes what you said of the garden. He knows the color of a rose is the color of a rose is the color. He sees the early sky lit by a burn toward which we sidle. He will take care of you, the dead man will do that. He will wait for your hair to grow back. He thinks the things you touched are lucky to be yours. The dead man knows where to be and where not to be, how he survives. He is aware, at all times, of your place, your dog, your rug, your roof, your chairs and tables. Here is his own table, from the basement of the “as is” shop. The dead man is of this old table, he is of his front and back doors, he is of the tea on the burner   and the burner, too, he is. It cannot stop the dead man, that others have caught on. The dead man at his worst still looks his best.   2. More About the Dead Man and Your Hands  Nights, he lets in the world, the dead man does it, always. By any late night, he has lost the need to believe. The dead man plays a nighttime piano, he blows a nighttime horn, he sings more after midnight.  Dead man's music is nighttime, call it earthly, call it planetary. The dead man feels the high registers heard by animal ears. He feels the rumbly pedal note struck by redwoods enlarging and tectonic plates lurching. What is it about his hands and your hands, is it the absence of certainty? He has stirred distinctions into a broth, a soup, a stew, a gravy. You cannot find yes and no, true or false, in a dead man's soup. So what if they have caught on, the dead man is out front and stays up later. Hence, when the dead man maketh eyes, he's gotcha. He'll care for you, now that he's gotcha, and he hath giveth his hand. He can't talk about the children if you are going to cry.    – Zen admonition    1. About the Dead Man and Nothing  The dead man knows nothing.

" – Zen admonition    1. About the Dead Man and Nothing  The dead man knows nothing. He is powerless to stop the battles, he has no way to reattach the arms and legs. He cannot stuff the fallen soldier's insides back inside. He has no expertise in the matter of civilian corpses, nor of friendly fire, nor beheadings, nor   revenge, nor suicide. He does not know the depth of depth charges, or the exact pressure that detonates a land mine. The dead man has given his all so that now, if he once knew, he knows nothing. He is emptied, he is the resonant cavity of which he spoke when it was music he was thinking of. Let him be now the leftover button of his work shirt. Permit him his fading mirror, his sputtering circuits, his secrets, his tears, his noonday duels   with the sun. Let him ride the roads in the bucket of an earth mover, can it hurt? Let him stand under the icicles, can he catch cold? For the dead man is stagnant without knowledge, and he cannot survive the demise of   philosophy or art.  To the dead man they were not spectacles, but survival skills. To the dead man, the world was but a birthmark that befell original space. To say that the dead man knows nothing is to see him at the beginning, who can it hurt? Before all this, he was nothing.   2. More About the Dead Man and Nothing  Don't bet he won't be born. Before all this, this that is so much, he was not himself. He was the free heat of space and then the salt of the earth. He was the ring around the moon, foretelling. The dead man had no station when he came to be, just a strange nakedness in the light. He did not know what he was to do, this was before clocks. So he decided to stab the dirt, to tumble in happiness and writhe in pain, and to flap his way   into space. To go home. It was a swell idea for the dead man, and he pinned it to his chest. Give him that, that he crystallized a plan, that he made from smoke something to him as real as   quartz, ivory, or the hoof of a gelding. The dead man had the whole world to transform or perfect or outlive. He wrote the book of nothing and no-time that entombed all time and all that took place in time. The dead man could not be hammered by analysis. Let him horn in on your fury, whatever it was, and it will abate. The energy that became form will disperse, never again to be what we were.

Still, he is a lion on the gurney. I talk a little to make sure he's dead. I have some memory of riding his shoulders through the fragrant night. Three fish coiled in a creel. So many butterflies and gnats, it was two-thirds Kenya, one-third Illinois. And then home: the clink of ice and gin. And so I rub his hair, which is unwashed, and will remain unwashed, for we will burn him. I touch the blade of his chest. Think of all those years I spent hovering beneath the scent of Marlboros, the mouthwash trace of booze; all that ice cracking, going stale: crowned molars and mimic glaciers fading to bled-out amber among the cuticles of lime. Maybe that's why when he so blindly flies on that exaltation of velocity and gas, he doesn't linger in this world awhile as word or song, a density we might gather round— an aquifer, or gushing spring, as pure as gin. Instead, he departs as vapor. Fragments of tooth and bone in the swept-out mass I can throw back to dirt, or spread—a child's sugared, grainy drink— to water.

Let my death be of my choice, for your mere choice  continues me in life.  Let me not die of harshness, Fabio, when I can die of love. That will do you credit, redeem me, since to die for love, not for guilt, is no less a death, but more an honoured one.  And now, finally, I seek your pardon for all the wrongs I did to you through love. Wrongs they are and they deserve your scorn. Your offence is just in my accosting you, because by loving you  I turn you to ingratitude.Love opened a mortal wound. In agony, I worked the blade to make it deeper. Please, I begged, let death come quick.  Wild, distracted, sick,  I counted, counted all the ways love hurt me. One life, I thought--a thousand deaths.  Blow after blowYou foolish men who lay the guilt on women, not seeing you're the cause of the very thing you blame;  if you invite their disdain with measureless desire why wish they well behave if you incite to ill.  You fight their stubbornness, then, weightily, you say it was their lightness when it was your guile.  In allSuspend, singer swan, the sweet strain: see how the lord that Delphi sees exchanges for you the gentle lyre for pipe and to Admetus makes a pastoral sound.

It isn't easy. It's dark in my room, the door is closed,  all around is creaking and sighing, as though I were in the hold  of a big ship, as though I were in the dark sleep of a huge freighter toiling across the landscape of the waves  taking me to my father with whom I have struggled  like Jacob with the angel and who heaves off, one final time,  the muddy counterpane of the earth and lies panting  beside his grave like a large dog who has run a long way.

"There are cemeteries that are lonely, graves full of bones that do not make a sound, the heart moving through a tunnel, in it darkness, darkness, darkness, like a shipwreck we die going into ourselves, as though we were drowning inside our hearts, as though we lived falling out of the skin into the soul.  And there are corpses, feet made of cold and sticky clay, death is inside the bones, like a barking where there are no dogs, coming out from bells somewhere, from graves somewhere, growing in the damp air like tears of rain.   Sometimes I see alone coffins under sail,  embarking with the pale dead, with women that have dead hair, with bakers who are as white as angels, and pensive young girls married to notary publics, caskets sailing up the vertical river of the dead, the river of dark purple, moving upstream with sails filled out by the sound of death, filled by the sound of death which is silence.  Death arrives among all that sound like a shoe with no foot in it, like a suit with no man in it, comes and knocks, using a ring with no stone in it, with no finger in it, comes and shouts with no mouth, with no tongue, with no throat. Nevertheless its steps can be heard and its clothing makes a hushed sound, like a tree.  I'm not sure, I understand only a little, I can hardly see, but it seems to me that its singing has the color of damp violets, of violets that are at home in the earth, because the face of death is green, and the look death gives is green, with the penetrating dampness of a violet leaf and the somber color of embittered winter.  But death also goes through the world dressed as a broom, lapping the floor, looking for dead bodies, death is inside the broom, the broom is the tongue of death looking for corpses, it is the needle of death looking for thread.  Death is inside the folding cots: it spends its life sleeping on the slow mattresses, in the black blankets, and suddenly breathes out: it blows out a mournful sound that swells the sheets, and the beds go sailing toward a port where death is waiting, dressed like an admiral.

"He gossips like my grandmother, this man with my face, and I could stand amused all afternoon in the Hon Kee Grocery, amid hanging meats he chops: roast pork cut from a hog hung by nose and shoulders, her entire skin burnt crisp, flesh I know to be sweet, her shining face grinning up at ducks dangling single file, each pierced by black hooks through breast, bill, and steaming from a hole stitched shut at the ass, I step to the counter, recite, and he, without even slightly varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue, scribbles my order on a greasy receipt, and chops it up quick.  Such a sorrowful Chinese face, nomad, Gobi, Northern in its boniness clear from the high warlike forehead to the sheer edge of the jaw. He could be my brother, but finer, and, except for his left forearm, which is engorged, sinewy from his daily grip and wield of a two-pound tool, he's delicate, narrow- waisted, his frame so slight a lover, some rough other might break it down its smooth, oily length. In his light-handed calligraphy on receipts and in his moodiness, he is a Southerner from a river-province; suited for scholarship, his face poised above an open book, he'd mumble his favorite passages. He could be my grandfather; come to America to get a Western education in 1917, but too homesick to study, he sits in the park all day, reading poems and writing letters to his mother.  He lops the head off, chops the neck of the duck into six, slits the body open, groin to breast, and drains the scalding juices, then quarters the carcass with two fast hacks of the cleaver, old blade that has worn into the surface of the round foot-thick chop-block a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel.  The head, flung from the body, opens down the middle where the butcher cleanly halved it between the eyes, and I see, foetal-crouched inside the skull, the homunculus, gray brain grainy to eat. Did this animal, after all, at the moment its neck broke, image the way his executioner  shrinks from his own death? Is this how I, too, recoil from my day? See how this shape hordes itself, see how little it is. See its grease on the blade. Is this how I'll be found when judgement is passed, when names are called, when crimes are tallied? This is also how I looked before I tore my mother open. Is this how I presided over my century, is this how I regarded the murders? This is also how I prayed. Was it me in the Other I prayed to when I prayed? This too was how I slept, clutching my wife. Was it me in the other I loved when I loved another? The butcher sees me eye this delicacy. With a finger, he picks it out of the skull-cradle and offers it to me. I take it gingerly between my fingers and suck it down. I eat my man.  The noise the body makes when the body meets the soul over the soul's ocean and penumbra is the old sound of up-and-down, in-and-out, a lump of muscle chug-chugging blood into the ear; a lover's heart-shaped tongue; flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes; the butcher working at his block and blade to marry their shapes by violence and time; an engine crossing, re-crossing salt water, hauling immigrants and the junk of the poor. These are the faces I love, the bodies and scents of bodies  for which I long in various ways, at various times, thirteen gathered around the redwood, happy, talkative, voracious at day's end, eager to eat four kinds of meat prepared four different ways, numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables, each made by distinct affections and brought to table by many hands.  Brothers and sisters by blood and design, who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes, we constitute a many-membered body of love. In a world of shapes of my desires, each one here is a shape of one of my desires, and each is known to me and dear by virtue of each one's unique corruption of those texts, the face, the body: that jut jaw to gnash tendon; that wide nose to meet the blows a face like that invites; those long eyes closing on the seen; those thick lips to suck the meat of animals or recite 300 poems of the T'ang; these teeth to bite my monosyllables; these cheekbones to make those syllables sing the soul. Puffed or sunken according to the life, dark or light according to the birth, straight or humped, whole, manqué, quasi, each pleases, verging on utter grotesquery. All are beautiful by variety. The soul too is a debasement of a text, but, thus, it acquires salience, although a  human salience, but inimitable, and, hence, memorable. God is the text. The soul is a corruption and a mnemonic.  A bright moment, I hold up an old head from the sea and admire the haughty down-curved mouth that seems to disdain all the eyes are blind to, including me, the eater. Whole unto itself, complete without me, yet its shape complements the shape of my mind. I take it as text and evidence of the world's love for me, and I feel urged to utterance, urged to read the body of the world, urged to say it in human terms, my reading a kind of eating, my eating a kind of reading, my saying a diminishment, my noise a love-in-answer. What is it in me would  devour the world to utter it? What is it in me will not let the world be, would eat not just this fish, but the one who killed it, the butcher who cleaned it. I would eat the way he squats, the way he reaches into the plastic tubs and pulls out a fish, clubs it, takes it to the sink, guts it, drops it on the weighing pan. I would eat that thrash and plunge of the watery body in the water, that liquid violence between the man's hands, I would eat  the gutless twitching on the scales, three pounds of dumb nerve and pulse, I would eat it all to utter it. The deaths at the sinks, those bodies prepared for eating, I would eat, and the standing deaths at the counters, in the aisles, the walking deaths in the streets, the death-far-from-home, the death- in-a-strange-land, these Chinatown deaths, these American deaths. I would devour this race to sing it, this race that according to Emerson  I would eat these features, eat the last three or four thousand years, every hair. And I would eat Emerson, his transparent soul, his soporific transcendence. I would eat this head, glazed in pepper-speckled sauce, the cooked eyes opaque in their sockets. I bring it to my mouth and-- the way I was taught, the way I've watched  others before me do-- with a stiff tongue lick out the cheek-meat and the meat over the armored jaw, my eating, its sensual, salient nowness, punctuating the void from which such hunger springs and to which it proceeds.  And what is this I excavate with my mouth? What is this plated, ribbed, hinged architecture, this , but one more articulation of a single nothing severally manifested? What is my eating, rapt as it is, but another shape of going, my immaculate expiration?  O, nothing is so steadfast it won't go the way the body goes. The body goes. The body's grave, so serious in its dying, arduous as martyrs in that task and as glorious. It goes empty always and announces its going by spasms and groans, farts and sweats.  What I thought were the arms  aching , were the knees trembling . What I thought were the muscles insisting  were the pores hissing and . What I thought was the body humming  was the body sighing . O, the murderous deletions, the keening down to nothing, the cleaving. All of the body's revisions end in death. All of the body's revisions end.  Bodies eating bodies, heads eating heads, we are nothing eating nothing, and though we feast, are filled, overfilled, we go famished. We gang the doors of death. That is, out deaths are fed that we may continue our daily dying, our bodies going down, while the plates-soon-empty are passed around, that true direction of our true prayers, while the butcher spells his message, manifold, in the mortal air. He coaxes, cleaves, brings change before our very eyes, and at every moment of our being. As we eat we're eaten. Else what is this violence, this salt, this passion, this heaven?  I thought the soul an airy thing. I did not know the soul is cleaved so that the soul might be restored. Live wood hewn, its sap springs from a sticky wound. No seed, no egg has he whose business calls for an axe. In the trade of my soul's shaping, he traffics in hews and hacks.  No easy thing, violence. One of its names? Change. Change resides in the embrace of the effaced and the effacer, in the covenant of the opened and the opener; the axe accomplishes it on the soul's axis. What then may I do  but cleave to what cleaves me. I kiss the blade and eat my meat. I thank the wielder and receive, while terror spirits my change, sorrow also. The terror the butcher scripts in the unhealed air, the sorrow of his Shang dynasty face, African face with slit eyes. He is my sister, this beautiful Bedouin, this Shulamite, keeper of sabbaths, diviner of holy texts, this dark dancer, this Jew, this Asian, this one with the Cambodian face, Vietnamese face, this Chinese I daily face, this immigrant, this man with my own face.

"History has to live with what was here, clutching and close to fumbling all we had— it is so dull and gruesome how we die, unlike writing, life never finishes.

Vague though the population of the earth Lay stretched and dry below the cypresses, It was not round-about but in my night, Bone of my bone, as an old man might say; And all its stone weighed my mortality; The pool would be my body and my eyes,  The air my garment and material Whereof that wateriness and mirror lived— The colorable, meek and limpid world.

"My dumpy little mother on the undertaker's slab had a mannequin's grace. From chin to foot the sheet outlined her, thin and tall. Her face uptilted, bloodless, smooth, had a long smile.  Her head rested on a block under her nape, her neck was long, her hair waved, upswept. But later, at ""the viewing,"" sunk in the casket in pink tulle, an expensive present that might spoil, dressed in Eden's green apron, organdy bonnet on, she shrank, grew short again, and yellow. Who put the gold-rimmed glasses on her shut face, who laid her left hand with the wedding ring on her stomach that really didn't seem to be there under the fake lace?  Mother's work before she died was self-purification, a regimen of near starvation, to be worthy to go  to Our Father, Whom she confused (or, more aptly, fused) with our father, in Heaven long since. She believed in evacuation, an often and fierce purgation, meant to teach the body to be hollow, that the soul may wax plump. At the moment of her death, the wind rushed out from all her pipes at once. Throat and rectum sang together, a galvanic spasm, hiss of ecstasy. Then, a flat collapse. Legs and arms flung wide, like that female Spanish saint slung by the ankles to a cross, her mouth stayed open in a dark O. So, her vigorous soul whizzed free. On the undertaker's slab, she lay youthful, cool, triumphant, with a long smile.  Blue, but you are Rose, too, and buttermilk, but with blood dots showing through.

"Since you ask, most days I cannot remember. I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage. Then the almost unnameable lust returns.  Even then I have nothing against life.  I know well the grass blades you mention, the furniture you have placed under the sun.  But suicides have a special language. Like carpenters they want to know  They never ask   Twice I have so simply declared myself, have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy, have taken on his craft, his magic.  In this way, heavy and thoughtful, warmer than oil or water, I have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole.  I did not think of my body at needle point. Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone. Suicides have already betrayed the body.  Still-born, they don't always die, but dazzled, they can't forget a drug so sweet that even children would look on and smile.  To thrust all that life under your tongue!-- that, all by itself, becomes a passion. Death's a sad Bone; bruised, you'd say,  and yet she waits for me, year after year, to so delicately undo an old wound, to empty my breath from its bad prison.  Balanced there, suicides sometimes meet, raging at the fruit, a pumped-up moon, leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss,  leaving the page of the book carelessly open, something unsaid, the phone off the hook and the love, whatever it was, an infection.I have gone out, a possessed witch, haunting the black air, braver at night; dreaming evil, I have done my hitch over the plain houses, light by light: lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.

"There were three stout pillars that held up all The weight and tradition of Wingate Hall. One was Cudjo and one was you And the third was the mistress, Mary Lou. Mary Lou Wingate, as slightly made And as hard to break as a rapier-blade. Bristol's daughter and Wingate's bride, Never well since the last child died But staring at pain with courteous eyes. When the pain outwits it, the body dies, Meanwhile the body bears the pain. She loved her hands and they made her vain, The tiny hands of her generation That gathered the reins of the whole plantation; The velvet sheathing the steel demurely In the trained, light grip that holds so surely.  She was at work by candlelight, She was at work in the dead of night, Smoothing out troubles and healing schisms And doctoring phthisics and rheumatisms, Guiding the cooking and watching the baking, The sewing, the soap-and-candle-making, The brewing, the darning, the lady-daughters, The births and deaths in the negro-quarters, Seeing that Suke had some new, strong shoes And Joe got a week in the calaboose, While Dicey's Jacob escaped a whipping And the jellybag dripped with its proper dripping, And the shirts and estrangements were neatly mended, And all of the tasks that never ended.  Her manner was gracious but hardly fervent And she seldom raised her voice to a servant. She was often mistaken, not often blind, And she knew the whole duty of womankind, To take the burden and have the power And seem like the well-protected flower, To manage a dozen industries With a casual gesture in scraps of ease, To hate the sin and to love the sinner And to see that the gentlemen got their dinner Ready and plenty and piping-hot Whether you wanted to eat or not. And always, always, to have the charm That makes the gentlemen take your arm But never the bright, unseemly spell That makes strange gentlemen love too well, Once you were married and settled down With a suitable gentleman of your own.  And when that happened, and you had bred The requisite children, living and dead, To pity the fool and comfort the weak And always let the gentlemen speak, To succor your love from deep-struck roots When gentlemen went to bed in their boots, And manage a gentleman's whole plantation In the manner befitting your female station.  This was the creed that her mother taught her And the creed that she taught to every daughter. She knew her Bible—and how to flirt With a swansdown fan and a brocade skirt. For she trusted in God but she liked formalities And the world and Heaven were both realities. —In Heaven, of course, we should all be equal, But, until we came to that golden sequel, Gentility must keep to gentility Where God and breeding had made things stable, While the rest of the cosmos deserved civility But dined in its boots at the second-table.  This view may be reckoned a trifle narrow, But it had the driving force of an arrow, And it helped Mary Lou to stand up straight, For she was gentle, but she could hate And she hated the North with the hate of Jael When the dry hot hands went seeking the nail, The terrible hate of women's ire, The smoky, the long-consuming fire. The Yankees were devils, and she could pray, For devils, no doubt, upon Judgment Day, But now in the world, she would hate them still And send the gentlemen out to kill.  The gentlemen killed and the gentlemen died, But she was the South's incarnate pride That mended the broken gentlemen And sent them out to the war again, That kept the house with the men away And baked the bricks where there was no clay, Made courage from terror and bread from bran And propped the South on a swansdown fan Through four long years of ruin and stress, The pride—and the deadly bitterness.  Let us look at her now, let us see her plain, She will never be quite like this again. Her house is rocking under the blast And she hears it tremble, and still stands fast, But this is the last, this is the last. The last of the wine and the white corn meal, The last high fiddle singing the reel, The last of the silk with the Paris label, The last blood-thoroughbred safe in the stable —Yellow corn meal and a jackass colt, A door that swings on a broken bolt, Brittle old letters spotted with tears And a wound that rankles for fifty years— This is the last of Wingate Hall, The last bright August before the Fall, Death has been near, and Death has passed, But this is the last, this is the last. There will be hope, and a scratching pen, There will be cooking for tired men, The waiting for news with shut, hard fists, And the blurred, strange names in the battle-lists, The April sun and the April rain, But never this day come back again.It rained a lot that spring. You woke in the morning And saw the sky still clouded, the streets still wet, But nobody noticed so much, except the taxis And the people who parade. You don't, in a city. The parks got very green. All the trees were green Far into July and August, heavy with leaf, Heavy with leaf   When Daniel Boone goes by, at night,  The phantom deer arise  And all lost, wild America  Is burning in their eyes.

"On summer afternoons I sit Quiescent by you in the park And idly watch the sunbeams gild And tint the ash-trees' bark.

"Suddenly night crushed out the day and hurled Her remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled. Then fell a stillness such as harks appalled When far-gone dead return upon the world.  There watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke. Each one whom Life exiled I named and called. But they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled; And never one fared back to me or spoke.  Then peered the indefinite unshapen dawn With vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds, The weak-limned hour when sick men’s sighs are drained. And while I wondered on their being withdrawn, Gagged by the smothering wing which none unbinds, I dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained. It seemed that out of the battle I escaped Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped Through granites which Titanic wars had groined.  Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned, Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred. Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared With piteous recognition inWho are these? Why sit they here in twilight? Wherefore rock they, purgatorial shadows, Drooping tongues from jaws that slob their relish, Baring teeth that leer like skulls’ tongues wicked?

I am leading a quiet life in Mike’s Place every day watching the champs of the Dante Billiard Parlor and the French pinball addicts. I am leading a quiet life on lower East Broadway. I am an American. I was an American boy. I read the American Boy Magazine and became a boy scout in the suburbs. I thought I was Tom Sawyer catching crayfish in the Bronx River and imagining the Mississippi. I had a baseball mit and an American Flyer bike. I delivered the Woman’s Home Companion at five in the afternoon or the Herald Trib at five in the morning. I still can hear the paper thump on lost porches. I had an unhappy childhood. I saw Lindberg land. I looked homeward and saw no angel. I got caught stealing pencils from the Five and Ten Cent Store the same month I made Eagle Scout. I chopped trees for the CCC and sat on them. I landed in Normandy in a rowboat that turned over. I have seen the educated armies on the beach at Dover. I have seen Egyptian pilots in purple clouds shopkeepers rolling up their blinds at midday potato salad and dandelions at anarchist picnics. I am reading ‘Lorna Doone’ and a life of John Most terror of the industrialist a bomb on his desk at all times. I have seen the garbagemen parade in the Columbus Day Parade behind the glib farting trumpeters. I have not been out to the Cloisters in a long time nor to the Tuileries but I still keep thinking  of going. I have seen the garbagemen parade when it was snowing.  I have eaten hotdogs in ballparks. I have heard the Gettysburg Address and the Ginsberg Address. I like it here and I won’t go back where I came from. I too have ridden boxcars boxcars boxcars. I have travelled among unknown men. I have been in Asia with Noah in the Ark. I was in India  when Rome was built. I have been in the Manger with an Ass. I have seen the Eternal Distributor from a White Hill in South San Francisco and the Laughing Woman at Loona Park outside the Fun House in a great rainstorm still laughing. I have heard the sound of revelry by night. I have wandered lonely as a crowd. I am leading a quiet life outside of Mike’s Place every day watching the world walk by in its curious shoes. I once started out to walk around the world but ended up in Brooklyn. That Bridge was too much for me. I have engaged in silence exile and cunning. I flew too near the sun and my wax wings fell off. I am looking for my Old Man whom I never knew. I am looking for the Lost Leader with whom I flew. Young men should be explorers. Home is where one starts from. But Mother never told me there’d be scenes like this. Womb-weary I rest I have travelled. I have seen goof city. I have seen the mass mess. I have heard Kid Ory cry. I have heard a trombone preach. I have heard Debussy strained thru a sheet. I have slept in a hundred islands where books were trees. I have heard the birds that sound like bells. I have worn grey flannel trousers and walked upon the beach of hell. I have dwelt in a hundred cities where trees were books. What subways what taxis what cafes! What women with blind breasts limbs lost among skyscrapers! I have seen the statues of heroes at carrefours. Danton weeping at a metro entrance Columbus in Barcelona pointing Westward up the Ramblas toward the American Express Lincoln in his stony chair And a great Stone Face in North Dakota. I know that Columbus did not invent America. I have heard a hundred housebroken Ezra Pounds. They should all be freed. It is long since I was a herdsman. I am leading a quiet life in Mike’s Place every day reading the Classified columns. I have read the Reader’s Digest from cover to cover and noted the close identification of the United States and the Promised Land where every coin is marked In God We Trust but the dollar bills do not have it being gods unto themselves. I read the Want Ads daily looking for a stone a leaf an unfound door. I hear America singing in the Yellow Pages. One could never tell the soul has its rages. I read the papers every day and hear humanity amiss in the sad plethora of print. I see where Walden Pond has been drained to make an amusement park. I see they’re making Melville eat his whale. I see another war is coming but I won’t be there to fight it. I have read the writing on the outhouse wall. I helped Kilroy write it. I marched up fifth Avenue blowing on a bugle in a tight platoon but hurried back to the Casbah looking for my dog. I see a similarity between dogs and me. Dogs are the true observers walking up and down the world thru the Molloy country. I have walked down alleys too narrow for Chryslers. I have seen a hundred horseless milkwagons in a vacant lot in Astoria. Ben Shahn never painted them but they’re there askew in Astoria. I have heard the junkman’s obbligato. I have ridden superhighways and believed the billboard’s promises Crossed the Jersey Flats and seen the Cities of the Plain And wallowed in the wilds of Westchester with its roving bands of natives in stationwagons. I have seen them. I am the man. I was there. I suffered somewhat. I am an American. I have a passport. I did not suffer in public. And I’m too young to die. I am a selfmade man. And I have plans for the future. I am in line for a top job. I may be moving on to Detroit. I am only temporarily a tie salesman. I am a good Joe. I am an open book to my boss. I am a complete mystery to my closest friends. I am leading a quiet life in Mike’s Place every day contemplating my navel. I am a part of the body’s long madness. I have wandered in various nightwoods. I have leaned in drunken doorways. I have written wild stories without punctuation.  I am the man. I was there. I suffered somewhat. I have sat in an uneasy chair. I am a tear of the sun.  I am a hill where poets run. I invented the alphabet after watching the flight of cranes who made letters with their legs. I am a lake upon a plain. I am a word  in a tree. I am a hill to poetry. I am a raid on the inarticulate. I have dreamt that all my teeth fell out but my tongue lived to tell the tale. For I am a still of poetry. I am a bank of song. I am a playerpiano in an abandoned casino on a seaside esplanade in a dense fog still playing. I see a similarity between the Laughing Woman and myself. I have heard the sound of summer in the rain. I have seen girls on boardwalks have complicated sensations. I understand their hesitations. I am a gatherer of fruit. I have seen how kisses cause euphoria. I have risked enchantment. I have seen the Virgin in an appletree at Chartres and Saint Joan burn at the Bella Union. I have seen giraffes in junglejims their necks like love wound around the iron circumstances of the world. I have seen the Venus Aphrodite armless in her drafty corridor. I have heard a siren sing at One Fifth Avenue. I have seen the White Goddess dancing in the Rue des Beaux Arts on the Fourteenth of July and the Beautiful Dame Without Mercy picking her nose in Chumley’s. She did not speak English. She had yellow hair and a hoarse voice and no bird sang. I am leading a quiet life in Mike’s Place every day watching the pocket pool players making the minestrone scene wolfing the macaronis and I have read somewhere the Meaning of Existence yet have forgotten just exactly where. But I am the man And I’ll be there. And I may cause the lips  of those who are asleep to speak. And I may make my notebooks into sheaves of grass. And I may write my own eponymous epitaph instructing the horsemen to pass.

"Then Almitra spoke, saying, We would ask now of Death.  And he said:  You would know the secret of death.  But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?  The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light.  If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.  For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.   In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond;  And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.  Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.  Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour.  Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king?  Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling?   For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun?  And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?   Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing.  And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.  And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.  Then the lawyer said, But what of our Laws, master?  And he answered;  You delight in laying down laws,  Yet you delight more in breaking them.  Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.  But while you build your sand-towersThen Almitra spoke again and said, And what of Marriage, master?  And he answered saying:  You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.  You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.  Ay, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.  But",Death

She took a doubtful step and then undid it To raise herself and look again. He spoke Advancing toward her: 'What is it you see From up there always--for I want to know.' She turned and sank upon her skirts at that, And her face changed from terrified to dull. He said to gain time: 'What is it you see,' Mounting until she cowered under him. 'I will find out now--you must tell me, dear.' She, in her place, refused him any help With the least stiffening of her neck and silence. She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see, Blind creature; and awhile he didn't see. But at last he murmured, 'Oh,' and again, 'Oh.'  'What is it--what?' she said. 'Just that I see.'  'You don't,' she challenged. 'Tell me what it is.'  'The wonder is I didn't see at once. I never noticed it from here before. I must be wonted to it--that's the reason. The little graveyard where my people are! So small the window frames the whole of it. Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it? There are three stones of slate and one of marble, Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight On the sidehill. We haven't to mind those. But I understand: it is not the stones, But the child's mound--'  'Don't, don't, don't, don't,' she cried.  She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm That rested on the bannister, and slid downstairs; And turned on him with such a daunting look, He said twice over before he knew himself: 'Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?'  'Not you! Oh, where's my hat? Oh, I don't need it! I must get out of here. I must get air. I don't know rightly whether any man can.'  'Amy! Don't go to someone else this time. Listen to me. I won't come down the stairs.' He sat and fixed his chin between his fists. 'There's something I should like to ask you, dear.'  'You don't know how to ask it.'  'Help me, then.'  Her fingers moved the latch for all reply.  'My words are nearly always an offense. I don't know how to speak of anything So as to please you. But I might be taught I should suppose.

I heard your rumbling voice Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why, But I went near to see with my own eyes.

But these things brought no pause To the saucily determined squirrel. His eyes were hungrily upturned To where the stars hung—icily clustered nuts Dotting trees of solitude. He saw the stars just over the horizon, And they seemed to grow  On trees that he could reach. So he scampered on, from branch to branch, Wondering why the fairy nut-trees Ran away from him. But, looking down, he spied A softly wild cheeked mountain pool, And there a handful of fairy nuts Bit into the indigo cupping them.

"  —Whitman  These are the last days my television says. Tornadoes, more rain, overcast, a chance  of sun but I do not trust weathermen, never have. In my fridge only  the milk makes sense— expires. No one, much less my parents, can tell me why  my middle name is Lowell, and from my table across from the Confederate  Monument to the dead (that pale finger bone) a plaque declares war—not Civil,  or Between the States, but for Southern Independence. In this café, below sea-  and eye-level a mural runs the wall, flaking, a plantation scene most do not see—  it's too much around the knees, height of a child. In its fields Negroes bend  to pick the endless white. In livery a few drive carriages like slaves, whipping the horses, faces  blank and peeling. The old hotel lobby this once was no longer welcomes guests—maroon ledger,  bellboys gone but for this. Like an inheritance the owner found it  stripping hundred years (at least) of paint and plaster. More leaves each day.  In my movie there are no horses, no heroes, only draftees fleeing  into the pines, some few who survive, gravely wounded, lying  burrowed beneath the dead— silent until the enemy bayonets what is believed  to be the last of the breathing. It is getting later. We prepare  for wars no longer there. The weather inevitable, unusual—  more this time of year than anyone ever seed. The earth shudders, the air—  if I did not know better, I would think we were living all along  a fault. How late it has gotten . . . Forget the weatherman  whose maps move, blink, but stay crossed with lines none has seen. Race  instead against the almost rain, digging beside the monument (that giant anchor)  till we strike water, sweat fighting the sleepwalking air.There are gods  of fertility, corn, childbirth,  & police  brutality—this last is offered praise  & sacrifice  near weekly & still cannot  be sated—many-limbed,  thin-skinned, its colors are blue  & black, a cross-  hatch of bruise & bulletholes  punched out  like my son’sWaking early with the warming house my grandmother knew what to do taking care not to wake Da Da she cooked up a storm in darkness adding silent spices and hot sauce  to stay cool.

" The lover's footprint in the sand  the ten-year-old kid's bare feet in the mud picking chili for rich growers, not those seeking cultural or ethnic roots, but those whose roots have been exposed, hacked, dug up and burned and in those roots do animals burrow for warmth; what is broken is blessed, not the knowledge and empty-shelled wisdom paraphrased from textbooks, not the mimicking nor plaques of distinction nor the ribbons and medals but after the privileged carriage has passed the breeze blows traces of wheel ruts away and on the dust will again be the people's broken footprints. What is broken God blesses, not the perfectly brick-on-brick prison but the shattered wall that announces freedom to the world, proclaims the irascible spirit of the human rebelling against lies, against betrayal, against taking what is not deserved; the human complaint is what God blesses, our impoverished dirt roads filled with cripples, what is broken is baptized, the irreverent disbeliever, the addict's arm seamed with needle marks is a thread line of a blanket frayed and bare from keeping the man warm. We are all broken ornaments, glinting in our worn-out work gloves, foreclosed homes, ruined marriages, from which shimmer our lives in their deepest truths, blood from the wound, broken ornaments— when we lost our perfection and honored our imperfect sentiments, we were blessed. Broken are the ghettos, barrios, trailer parks where gangs duel to death, yet through the wretchedness a woman of sixty comes riding her rusty bicycle, we embrace we bury in our hearts, broken ornaments, accused, hunted, finding solace and refuge we work, we worry, we love but always with compassion reflecting our blessings— in our brokenness thrives life, thrives light, thrives the essence of our strength, each of us a warm fragment, broken off from the greater ornament of the unseen, then rejoined as dust, to all this is.1.

"The ground cracked like the rough pit of a peach and snapped in two. The sun behind the mountains turned into an olive-green glow.  To niña Gloria this was home. She continued to sell her bowl of lemons, rubbing a cold, thin silver Christ pocketed in her apron. Others  like Lito and Marvin played  soldiers in the ruins of a school, running around mounds of bricks,  shooting chickens and pigs.  No one knows exactly how a light film of ash appeared on everyone’s eyelids early in the morning or how trout and mackerel plunged from the sky, twitched, leaped through the streets.  Some say the skin of trees felt like old newspaper, dry and yellow. Others believe the soapsuds washed aside in rivers began to rise in their milk.  One Monday morning, a rain fell  and the cemetery washed into the city. Bones began to knock  and knock at our doors. Streets became muddy rivers waiting for bodies to drop  among piles of dead fish.  In a year, everyone stabbed flowers on a grave.  This explains why women thought  and moved like lizards under stones, why men heard bees buzzing inside their skulls, why dogs lost their sense of smell sniffing piles of rubble to get back home.   In a few years, no one cared  about turtles banging their heads against rocks, bulls with their sad, busted eyes, parrots that kept diving into creeks, the dark swelling of the open ground or at night a knife stained the kitchen cloth.  Instead, niña Gloria swept the ground, the broom licking her feet at each stroke.  At the bus station, Marvin shined  military boots,  twenty-five cents a pair, reduced his words to a spit, a splutter  of broken sentences  on shoe polish, leather.  In the evenings, he counted coins  he’d tossed in a jar, then walked home, one step closer to the cracked bone clenched in the yellow jaw of a dog.

But I tell my friends if they don’t like you they are cheating themselves;  you were brought from Africa as seeds, hidden in the ears and hair of slaves.  Nothing was wasted in our kitchens.

"Some people find out they are Jews. They can't believe it. They had always hated Jews. As children they had roamed in gangs on winter nights in the old  neighborhood, looking for Jews. They were not Jewish, they were Irish. They brandished broken bottles, tough guys with blood on their  lips, looking for Jews. They intercepted Jewish boys walking alone and beat them up. Sometimes they were content to chase a Jew and he could elude  them by running away. They were happy just to see him run  away. The coward! All Jews were yellow. They spelled Jew with a small j jew. And now they find out they are Jews themselves. It happened at the time of the Spanish Inquisition. To escape persecution, they pretended to convert to Christianity. They came to this country and settled in the Southwest. At some point oral tradition failed the family, and their  secret faith died. No one would ever have known if not for the bones that turned up  on the dig. A disaster. How could it have happened to them? They are in a state of panic--at first. Then they realize that it is the answer to their prayers. They hasten to the synagogue or build new ones. They are Jews at last! They are free to marry other Jews, and divorce them, and intermarry  with Gentiles, God forbid. They are model citizens, clever and thrifty. They debate the issues. They fire off earnest letters to the editor. They vote. They are resented for being clever and thrifty. They buy houses in the suburbs and agree not to talk so loud. They look like everyone else, drive the same cars as everyone else,  yet in their hearts they know they're different. In every there are always two or three, hated by   the others, who give life to one ugly stereotype or another: The grasping Jew with the hooked nose or the Ivy League Bolshevik  who thinks he is the agent of world history.

To live in a state of perpetual war puts a tremendous burden on the  population. As a visitor he felt he had to share that burden. With his gift for codes and ciphers, he joined the counter-  terrorism unit of army intelligence. Contrary to what the spook novels say, he found it possible to  avoid betraying either his country or his lover. This was the life: strange bedrooms, the perfume of other men's  wives. As a spy he has a unique mission: to get his name on the front   page of the nation's newspaper of record. Only by doing that   would he get the message through to his immediate superior. If he goes to jail, he will do so proudly; if they're going to  hang him anyway, he'll do something worth hanging for.

"for Isaac Bashevis Singer   The melancholy of Chopin and cruel breathing folds back your sheets, and you rise like lightly leavened bread, like all the old, arthritic Jews left in the world, from your Sabbatical sleep.  You rise and wipe the crusted blood from your doorpost, kiss the angled , and are grateful you have again been spared the pestilence and the lice, the hailstones and the fissuring earth, the ambiguous knife of Abraham.  You go to the window, and through the Jew-eyes of this life you watch children stomp their booted feet against the sidewalk, grandmothers and grandfathers sew yellow stars onto their lapels and wrap their hungry bones in the long phylacteries.  It is 1979, you know it, but you have slept like a Jew. And dreamt like a Jew. And the dreams of all the persecuted Jews (the Jews chased by the Assyrians and the Babylonians, the Jews converted by the Egyptians and the Romans and the Hari Krishnas, the Jews baked like strudel and refined into lampshades by the resourceful Germans) swim like fresh sperm into the ovaries of your sleep, and you wake, pregnant and nauseous with Jew and with history and with your ambivalent God.  And then you go to the table, and (though you never believed God could enter through your mouth) you eat like a Jew, you feel the milk that does not want to sleep with the meat, and the meat that does not want to sleep with the milk, and you feel the stones of some vague guilt, the stones of  of the anxious bridegroom, Doom, and the reluctant bride, Joy, turn in your stomach like the ballast of some Hassidic boat that refuses to sail on the Sabbath. And it is always the Sabbath.  And then you go to your bed, and you make love to your wife like a Jew, with your desperate tongue and your mutilated penis and your envy of womanhood grown so large you are the best lover in the world, better than Robert Redford and all the skiers, better than the Black athletes with their beautiful, round buttocks that turn like greased bearings in your wife's Jew-hating dreams.If you are terrified of your own death, and want to escape from it, you may want to write a poem, for the poem might carry your name into eternity, the poem may become immortal, beyond flesh and fashion, it may be read in a thousand years by someone as frightened of death as you are, in a dark field, at night,Not merely because Henry James said there were but four rules of life— —but because it's good for the soul, and,  what's more, for others, it may be that kindness is our best audition for a worthier world, and, despite the vagueness and uncertainty of its recompense, a bird[I] retrace by moonlight the roads where I used to play in the sun.  — Marcel Proust   At night, when I go out to the field to listen to the birds sleep, the stars hover like old umpires over the diamond, and I think back upon the convergences of bats and balls, of",Identity

A woman like that is not a woman, quite. I have been her kind.  I have found the warm caves in the woods, filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves, closets, silks, innumerable goods; fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves: whining, rearranging the disaligned.

"He gossips like my grandmother, this man with my face, and I could stand amused all afternoon in the Hon Kee Grocery, amid hanging meats he chops: roast pork cut from a hog hung by nose and shoulders, her entire skin burnt crisp, flesh I know to be sweet, her shining face grinning up at ducks dangling single file, each pierced by black hooks through breast, bill, and steaming from a hole stitched shut at the ass, I step to the counter, recite, and he, without even slightly varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue, scribbles my order on a greasy receipt, and chops it up quick.  Such a sorrowful Chinese face, nomad, Gobi, Northern in its boniness clear from the high warlike forehead to the sheer edge of the jaw. He could be my brother, but finer, and, except for his left forearm, which is engorged, sinewy from his daily grip and wield of a two-pound tool, he's delicate, narrow- waisted, his frame so slight a lover, some rough other might break it down its smooth, oily length. In his light-handed calligraphy on receipts and in his moodiness, he is a Southerner from a river-province; suited for scholarship, his face poised above an open book, he'd mumble his favorite passages. He could be my grandfather; come to America to get a Western education in 1917, but too homesick to study, he sits in the park all day, reading poems and writing letters to his mother.  He lops the head off, chops the neck of the duck into six, slits the body open, groin to breast, and drains the scalding juices, then quarters the carcass with two fast hacks of the cleaver, old blade that has worn into the surface of the round foot-thick chop-block a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel.  The head, flung from the body, opens down the middle where the butcher cleanly halved it between the eyes, and I see, foetal-crouched inside the skull, the homunculus, gray brain grainy to eat. Did this animal, after all, at the moment its neck broke, image the way his executioner  shrinks from his own death? Is this how I, too, recoil from my day? See how this shape hordes itself, see how little it is. See its grease on the blade. Is this how I'll be found when judgement is passed, when names are called, when crimes are tallied? This is also how I looked before I tore my mother open. Is this how I presided over my century, is this how I regarded the murders? This is also how I prayed. Was it me in the Other I prayed to when I prayed? This too was how I slept, clutching my wife. Was it me in the other I loved when I loved another? The butcher sees me eye this delicacy. With a finger, he picks it out of the skull-cradle and offers it to me. I take it gingerly between my fingers and suck it down. I eat my man.  The noise the body makes when the body meets the soul over the soul's ocean and penumbra is the old sound of up-and-down, in-and-out, a lump of muscle chug-chugging blood into the ear; a lover's heart-shaped tongue; flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes; the butcher working at his block and blade to marry their shapes by violence and time; an engine crossing, re-crossing salt water, hauling immigrants and the junk of the poor. These are the faces I love, the bodies and scents of bodies  for which I long in various ways, at various times, thirteen gathered around the redwood, happy, talkative, voracious at day's end, eager to eat four kinds of meat prepared four different ways, numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables, each made by distinct affections and brought to table by many hands.  Brothers and sisters by blood and design, who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes, we constitute a many-membered body of love. In a world of shapes of my desires, each one here is a shape of one of my desires, and each is known to me and dear by virtue of each one's unique corruption of those texts, the face, the body: that jut jaw to gnash tendon; that wide nose to meet the blows a face like that invites; those long eyes closing on the seen; those thick lips to suck the meat of animals or recite 300 poems of the T'ang; these teeth to bite my monosyllables; these cheekbones to make those syllables sing the soul. Puffed or sunken according to the life, dark or light according to the birth, straight or humped, whole, manqué, quasi, each pleases, verging on utter grotesquery. All are beautiful by variety. The soul too is a debasement of a text, but, thus, it acquires salience, although a  human salience, but inimitable, and, hence, memorable. God is the text. The soul is a corruption and a mnemonic.  A bright moment, I hold up an old head from the sea and admire the haughty down-curved mouth that seems to disdain all the eyes are blind to, including me, the eater. Whole unto itself, complete without me, yet its shape complements the shape of my mind. I take it as text and evidence of the world's love for me, and I feel urged to utterance, urged to read the body of the world, urged to say it in human terms, my reading a kind of eating, my eating a kind of reading, my saying a diminishment, my noise a love-in-answer. What is it in me would  devour the world to utter it? What is it in me will not let the world be, would eat not just this fish, but the one who killed it, the butcher who cleaned it. I would eat the way he squats, the way he reaches into the plastic tubs and pulls out a fish, clubs it, takes it to the sink, guts it, drops it on the weighing pan. I would eat that thrash and plunge of the watery body in the water, that liquid violence between the man's hands, I would eat  the gutless twitching on the scales, three pounds of dumb nerve and pulse, I would eat it all to utter it. The deaths at the sinks, those bodies prepared for eating, I would eat, and the standing deaths at the counters, in the aisles, the walking deaths in the streets, the death-far-from-home, the death- in-a-strange-land, these Chinatown deaths, these American deaths. I would devour this race to sing it, this race that according to Emerson  I would eat these features, eat the last three or four thousand years, every hair. And I would eat Emerson, his transparent soul, his soporific transcendence. I would eat this head, glazed in pepper-speckled sauce, the cooked eyes opaque in their sockets. I bring it to my mouth and-- the way I was taught, the way I've watched  others before me do-- with a stiff tongue lick out the cheek-meat and the meat over the armored jaw, my eating, its sensual, salient nowness, punctuating the void from which such hunger springs and to which it proceeds.  And what is this I excavate with my mouth? What is this plated, ribbed, hinged architecture, this , but one more articulation of a single nothing severally manifested? What is my eating, rapt as it is, but another shape of going, my immaculate expiration?  O, nothing is so steadfast it won't go the way the body goes. The body goes. The body's grave, so serious in its dying, arduous as martyrs in that task and as glorious. It goes empty always and announces its going by spasms and groans, farts and sweats.  What I thought were the arms  aching , were the knees trembling . What I thought were the muscles insisting  were the pores hissing and . What I thought was the body humming  was the body sighing . O, the murderous deletions, the keening down to nothing, the cleaving. All of the body's revisions end in death. All of the body's revisions end.  Bodies eating bodies, heads eating heads, we are nothing eating nothing, and though we feast, are filled, overfilled, we go famished. We gang the doors of death. That is, out deaths are fed that we may continue our daily dying, our bodies going down, while the plates-soon-empty are passed around, that true direction of our true prayers, while the butcher spells his message, manifold, in the mortal air. He coaxes, cleaves, brings change before our very eyes, and at every moment of our being. As we eat we're eaten. Else what is this violence, this salt, this passion, this heaven?  I thought the soul an airy thing. I did not know the soul is cleaved so that the soul might be restored. Live wood hewn, its sap springs from a sticky wound. No seed, no egg has he whose business calls for an axe. In the trade of my soul's shaping, he traffics in hews and hacks.  No easy thing, violence. One of its names? Change. Change resides in the embrace of the effaced and the effacer, in the covenant of the opened and the opener; the axe accomplishes it on the soul's axis. What then may I do  but cleave to what cleaves me. I kiss the blade and eat my meat. I thank the wielder and receive, while terror spirits my change, sorrow also. The terror the butcher scripts in the unhealed air, the sorrow of his Shang dynasty face, African face with slit eyes. He is my sister, this beautiful Bedouin, this Shulamite, keeper of sabbaths, diviner of holy texts, this dark dancer, this Jew, this Asian, this one with the Cambodian face, Vietnamese face, this Chinese I daily face, this immigrant, this man with my own face. I buried my father in the sky. Since then, the birds clean and comb him every morning  and pull the blanket up to his chin  every night.  I buried my father underground.
